 A report says that the combined practice of continuous integration and continuous delivery (CI/CD) is a leading indicator of an organization's adoption of advanced practices associated with software supply chain security. Almost two-thirds of respondents said CI/CD was very or completely established in their organization.

According to Google's DevOps research, software developers are twice as likely to find a vulnerability in their code if they use tools that scan for it. The most popular security-scanning tool was application-level security scanning, the study found. It can be automated in CI/CD systems.

     “Without continuous integration in place, it’s probably difficult for an organization to ensure that they’re running a consistent set of scanners, linters, and tests against the software artifacts they create,” 
<br>
    said Claire Peters, lead researcher on Google Cloud’s DevOps Research and Assessment (DORA) team.

 Automated security scanning is the most common security practice among respondents to Google Cloud's DevOps Research and Assessment (DORA) survey. Organizations that use these tools are nearly twice as likely to report identifying a security vulnerability in their code or one of its dependencies. <a href="https://www.cybersecuritydive.com/news/cicd-strengthens-security/632947/" target="_blank"><b>Read the full article.</b></a>
