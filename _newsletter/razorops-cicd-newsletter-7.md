It can be difficult to troubleshoot code or tests generated by various teams. Cross-team coordination can exacerbate delays and take precedence over code quality. **[Continuous Integration (CI) and Continuous Delivery(CD)](https://bit.ly/3GnBqD9)** is a practical solution to this challenge. 

<br>
CI/CD is a word that is frequently used alongside terms like "DevOps," "Agile," "automation," and so on. These words are intended to define a modern development workflow that teams use to increase quality and productivity. From code development to production deployment, a **[CI/CD pipeline](https://bit.ly/3MUDCEy)** is a set of stages and automated actions that software goes through. The need for CI/CD is driven by a DevOps environment where teams are interested in deploying applications more often and with more agility. As Kubernetes adoption in enterprises rises, so is the need for CI/CD as it supports the container.

The latest trend in cutting-edge software development is containerization. Containers enable your software to be environment-agnostic while still maintaining consistent behavior across environments, a practice known as "cloud-native." Kubernetes is an open-source cloud platform for deploying and running cloud-native applications at scale. Despite its greatness, Kubernetes is difficult to set up and administer.

<br>
**[What are the advantages of Kubernetes Continuous Integration/Continuous Delivery?](https://bit.ly/3sZK6Ki)**
<br>

Both CI/CD workflows and cloud-native solutions strive to boost development velocity, improve software quality, and retain operability. Many processes between the time code are written and when it is released into production are automated with CI/CD. Kubernetes, on the other hand, automates container deployments across a variety of IT setups while ensuring effective resource consumption. As a result, enterprises should set up CI/CD pipelines that use the Kubernetes platform.

<br>
So far good but the main aim was not just to create an application, it is to run the application live and generate revenue that requires maintenance and management which in turn requires technical expertise. As an alternative to this, there are managed Kubernetes services where a 3rd party will take care of the application by maintaining and managing it for you. To know more about Kubernetes and managed Kubernetes service join us in tomorrow’s webinar: **[Kubernetes 101: Getting started with Kubernetes](https://bit.ly/3sVNfuL)** hosted by **[RazorOps](https://bit.ly/3lMFIdR)** in collaboration with **[DigitalOcean](https://www.digitalocean.com/)**.

By using the Kubernetes API to control the availability of the network services, customers can eliminate costly scripting and custom automation development.</p>
* <p><b><a href="https://community.cncf.io/events/details/cncf-cncf-online-programs-presents-cncf-on-demand-webinar-securing-windows-workloads/">CNCF On-Demand Webinar: Securing Windows Workloads</a> | Jun 2 - 3, 12:00 AM (PDT)| <a href="https://community.cncf.io/events/details/cncf-cncf-online-programs-presents-cncf-on-demand-webinar-securing-windows-workloads/">RSVP</a></b>- These days, everyone is familiar with Linux containers, and a popular way to run Linux-based binary files is in an isolated environment. A container is similar to a lightweight packaging technique. Windows also offer a container solution that allows users to pack Windows-based applications in an isolated environment. Kubernetes can run these packaged applications at scale, but what could be used to secure such workloads?</p>
