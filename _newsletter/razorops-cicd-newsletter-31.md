<a href="https://www.infoq.com/news/2022/11/kubecost-opencost/" target="_blank"><b>Kubecost Open Sources OpenCost: an Open Source Standard for Kubernetes Cost Monitoring</b></a>

The open-source Kubernetes OpenCost standard enables teams to work with a unified methodology for tracking, calculating, and controlling costs across many settings.

Webb Brown, CEO of Kubecost, spoke at KubeCon+CloudNativeCon NA 2022 and talked about OpenCost, its relevance to developers, and the state of Kubernetes cost management.

* What is the state of Kubernetes cost management today, and where are we heading?

* What does OpenCost enable for this ecosystem, and what integrations are being delivered to end-users?

* Are there any plans to integrate with other cloud providers or vendors?

* How is Kubecost going to be free for unlimited clusters? 

For Kubernetes, Kubecost creates tools for real-time cost management and monitoring. A vendor-neutral open-source project called OpenCost measures and distributes infrastructure and container expenses.
