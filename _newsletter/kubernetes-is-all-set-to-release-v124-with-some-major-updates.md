**A quick recap -** Way back in Dec 2020 Kubernetes announced the [deprecation of Dockershim](https://kubernetes.io/blog/2020/12/02/dont-panic-kubernetes-and-docker/) and it has been a constant topic of discussion. Digging a little deeper, Dockershim is a software shim that allows you to use the entire Docker engine as your container runtime within Kubernetes. Kubernetes is eliminating the middleman. 

**The present story -** Why are you reading about this now??? Well as per the latest updates Kubernetes is all set to release v1.24 somewhere around this month. 

<br>

Whether you have your cluster or are unsure as to how these changes are going to affect you, just check out [if you have any dependencies on Docker Engine.](https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/administer-cluster/migrating-from-dockershim/check-if-dockershim-deprecation-affects-you/)
