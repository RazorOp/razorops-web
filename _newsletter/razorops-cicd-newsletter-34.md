The Argo Project enables organizations to declaratively deploy and run cloud-native applications and workflows on Kubernetes using GitOps. The Argo Project was created and open-sourced in 2017 by Applatix, which was acquired by Intuit. The Argo project was accepted into the CNCF Incubator in April 2020. Intuit, along with BlackRock, has been heavily involved in the development and cultivation of the project and the community.

   ***"Graduating from the CNCF Incubator requires a project to reach difficult-to-attain milestones, significant adoption, diversity, and sustained growth," said Chris Aniszczyk, CTO of the CNCF. "Argo has shown itself to be an important piece of the cloud native technology stack and GitOps movement, we are thrilled to see it graduate."***

Argo consists of four Kubernetes-native sub-projects, including Argo Workflows, Argo Events, Argo CD, and Argo Rollouts. Argo consists of four Kubernetes-native sub-projects, including Argo Workflows, Argo Events, and Argo CD and Rollouts. These tools can be used independently, but there is great benefit in using them together to create and operate complex applications at scale. The other two projects aim to make GitOps' best practices significantly more approachable for engineers. The other two sub-projects, Argo CD and Argo Rollouts, help engineers understand, adopt, and use Kubernetes as well as make GitOps' best practices significantly more approachable for teams who want to adopt it.
