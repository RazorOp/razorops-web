The goal of any software company is to deliver value and trust to users by providing effective measures to solve a problem in a trusted way, so they prefer you over others. Using a microservices architecture facilitates making this goal reachable by delivering changes more quickly and effectively. Using these short cycles effectively can help teams provide valuable products to the end-user as per demands.


Faster release cycles are the prime advantages of microservices architectures. To attain agility with microservices, one must have a robust CI/CD strategy. When speaking about fast releases few terms can’t neglect:

**Continuous Integration:**  It is an automated process in which multiple codes are built, merged, and tested. It ensures the quality of the product.

**Continuous Delivery:** In this automated delivery process, complete codes are validated and tested, and prepared to get them ready for the deployment stage.

**Continuous Deployment:** This is the last stage of CI/CD that ensures every change in the code from the developer passes all the tests and approvals before being deployed for production.


**Here is the list of objectives for the CI/CD process in microservices architecture-**

* build and deploy the services independently.
* Each new release is validated before deployment.
* Deployments can be simultaneous.
* Adequate access control required.

**While integrating Microservices Architecture in CI/CD, the main challenges include: **

* Multiple Repository Usage in an organization.
* Mixed technologies used by teams
* Dependencies of services present.
* Centralized release management
* Service updation without breaking other services.


**Integrating microservices architecture in CI/CD provides several benefits:**

* Independent deployment provides agility to manage and release services.
* Smaller teams are highly driven and goal-oriented, which leads to high efficiency and more productivity through smoother communication.
* Small codes enable reusability and independence
* Teams can choose the best-fit technology.
* Individual fault management.
* Integration of various features for effective utilization of resources using services like Kubernetes.


*Microservice Architecture improves the overall CI/CD process by enhancing speed by fragmenting the entire process into sub-processes making them independent, fast, less error-prone, and easily manageable. **[RazorOps](https://bit.ly/3HyagtB)** provides microservice architecture using Kubernetes to enhance the capabilities of CI/CD processes with faster speed.*
