***Top Picks for you this week***

**[Hostpath volume in Kubernetes by Shyju Krishnan](https://blog.cloudnloud.com/hostpath-volume-in-kubernetes)**

Kubernetes will support hostpath in the multimode cluster. If you create a deployment set using the hostpath the container will be created and started, but the data will not sync in each container running on multiple hosts. A host path is a type of persistent volume that will mount a file or directory from the host node’s filesystem into your pod....If you want the same data in each container within the deployment set, we need common disk space. I hope you have got an idea about Kubernetes Hostpath and how to mount the HostPath inside the pod.

**[Image Hardening for Security by Murali Doss](https://blog.cloudnloud.com/image-hardening-for-security)**

In the world of microservices, the use of images is inevitable and they are used very extensively. The more we use images, the higher the possibility of them being vulnerable. Therefore, image hardening has become a mandated process in all the major compliance frameworks such as HIPAA, PCI-DSS, FedRamp, and so on.
