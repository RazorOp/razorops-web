 Kubernetes is a portable, extensible, open-source platform for managing containerized workloads and services. Kubernetes facilitates both declarative configuration and automation. It has a large, rapidly growing ecosystem. Kubernetes services, support, and tools are widely available.

<br>
Organizations need to deploy their software quickly, leveraging highly scalable and always available capabilities to maintain zero downtime. As more applications are containerized and deployed, it becomes increasingly complex for any organization to manage these containers. Kubernetes is a powerful tool to manage and scale cloud-native applications. You can easily automate, deploy, scale, and monitor your applications with this tool.

<br>
**[The RazorOps Platform](https://bit.ly/3bwrLP5)** is designed with all the tools necessary to easily boost your Kubernetes deployments. It enables you to group relevant components of your infrastructure, giving each one a "node" in the cluster to facilitate the management, monitoring, and updating.

<br>
You can easily specify your deployment stage, target infrastructure, and execution strategy with RazorOps using its user-friendly interface. Due to its rapid growth, Kubernetes has emerged as a platform that organizations and developers must be familiar with. **[Request a demo today](https://bit.ly/3R7GoZM)**.

***Top Picks for you this week***


**[Kubernetes-accelerated microservice deployment using RazorOps](https://kubeify.medium.com/razorops-speeding-up-the-deployment-of-microservices-with-kubernetes-e07e50a0ee43)**

 RazorOps eases the deployment of microservices using Kubernetes clusters. Hence microservices adoption becomes a lot easier when containers are utilized for packaged delivery.

**[5 Prime Advantages of Virtualization](https://bit.ly/3yBDsNq)**

Virtualization uses software to create an abstract layer over the hardware. By doing this it creates a virtual computer system, known as virtual machines (VMs) This will allow organizations to run multiple virtual computers, operating systems, and applications on a single physical server.
