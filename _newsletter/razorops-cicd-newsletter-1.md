[Kubernetes is all set to release v1.24 with some major updates.](https://kubernetes.io/blog/2022/04/07/upcoming-changes-in-kubernetes-1-24/#api-removals-deprecations-and-other-changes-for-kubernetes-1-24)
<br>

**A quick recap -** Way back in Dec 2020 Kubernetes announced the [deprecation of Dockershim](https://kubernetes.io/blog/2020/12/02/dont-panic-kubernetes-and-docker/) and it has been a constant topic of discussion. Digging a little deeper, Dockershim is a software shim that allows you to use the entire Docker engine as your container runtime within Kubernetes. Kubernetes is eliminating the middleman. 

**The present story -** Why are you reading about this now??? Well as per the latest updates Kubernetes is all set to release v1.24 somewhere around this month.
