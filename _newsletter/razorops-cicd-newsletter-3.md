Google and the Istio Steering Committee have submitted the Istio project for consideration as an incubating project within the Cloud Native Computing Foundation (CNCF). Istio is the last major component of organizations’ Kubernetes ecosystem to sit outside of the CNCF, and its APIs are well-aligned to Kubernetes. Acceptance of Istio will complete the cloud-native stack under the auspices of the foundation, and bring Istio closer to the Kubernetes project.

**[KubeCon + CloudNativeCon Europe 2022 mask mandate post mortem](https://www.cncf.io/blog/2022/04/28/kubecon-cloudnativecon-europe-2022-mask-mandate-post-mortem/)**

Masks are no longer required to be worn at the event as mask mandates had been dropped in countries around Europe (18 countries in the European region, including Spain which dropped it for the first time in the pandemic on April 20) Based on everything, we felt that it is possible to drop the mask requirement at the events in Spain, though we still recommend them. Find out other requirements to attend the event.

A container image is comprised of multiple layers, an image is essentially built from the instructions and executable version of an application. Once a container image is created, you like to distribute it within a team or you like to use it in your CI/CD pipeline to deploy this image in various environments. Now you need to store, manage, and secure your Docker container images here container registry systems come into the picture.
