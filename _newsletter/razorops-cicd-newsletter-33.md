<a href="https://researchsnipers.com/over-a-thousand-docker-container-images-were-found-hiding-malicious-content/" target="_blank"><b>Over a thousand Docker container images were found hiding malicious content.</b></a>

Almost 2,000 images of unconfirmed photographs that "Sysdig" analyzed were determined to contain obscene content. AWS login information, SSH keys, the GIT hub, and NPM tokens were also included in the images. According to the <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/feed/hashtag/software?lipi=urn%3Ali%3Apage%3Ad_flagship3_pulse_read%3BiBi0DSdVQHafHWMVS6XyJQ%3D%3D" target="_blank"><b>#software</b></a> study, this covert malware can gain access to one's containers and act as a backdoor.

The most common method used by hackers to attack images was "typosquatting." This year has seen a 15% increase in this type of spam, with the majority of infected images coming from public libraries. These images, along with two typosquatted images, were downloaded at least 17,000 times.
