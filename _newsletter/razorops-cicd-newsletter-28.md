The container revolution was started by Docker, which is still active and perhaps doing better financially than it was back then (only to be eclipsed by Kubernetes and its ecosystem). The company today announced the preview of its WebAssembly (Wasm) support's initial technical preview.

“We see Wasm as a <a href="https://www.docker.com/blog/why-containers-and-webassembly-work-well-together/" target="_blank"><b>complementary technology </b></a> to Linux containers where developers can choose which technology they use (or both!) depending on the use case,” Docker’s Michael Irwin writes in today’s announcement. “And as the community explores what’s possible with Wasm, we want to help make Wasm applications easier to develop, build and run using the experience and tools you know and love.”


Docker also revealed today that it will become a voting member of the Bytecode Alliance, the nonprofit organization that created WebAssembly and the WebAssembly System Interface, which enables these new initiatives.
