CI/CD is a modern software practice with roots in the Agile methodology and is foundational to DevOps practices that blur the lines between IT operations and software development. CI/CD stands for Continuous Integration (CI) and Continuous Delivery (CD). It aims to fortify software development and delivery pipelines by establishing security best practices early and continuously in the process.
<br>
<br>
**What is CI/CD Security?**

CI/CD security is a continuous process that seeks to identify and mitigate security weaknesses and vulnerabilities at every stage of the CI/CD pipeline using such techniques as:

*     Source composition analysis
*     Static application security testing
*     CI/CD access controls
*     Runtime security

The importance of CI/CD pipelines has grown, especially as a vital part of developing and deploying cloud-native applications. This increased profile heightens the need to protect them with security best practices while keeping their security goals top of mind.
