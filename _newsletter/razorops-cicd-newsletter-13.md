The **[#business](https://www.linkedin.com/feed/hashtag/business?lipi=urn%3Ali%3Apage%3Ad_flagship3_pulse_read%3BGnc%2BSIkfQ%2FGLMRrL%2FsgbNw%3D%3D)** advantages of CI/CD pipeline for your **[#startup](https://www.linkedin.com/feed/hashtag/startup?lipi=urn%3Ali%3Apage%3Ad_flagship3_pulse_read%3BGnc%2BSIkfQ%2FGLMRrL%2FsgbNw%3D%3D)** include a variety of advantages for your company. Continuous quality means continuous integration and delivery for your startup. Instead of waiting for the entire software or application to be finished, a CI/CD pipeline lets the owner of a tech firm start making money from the released feature.


**What are the other benefits of the Continous Integration -Continuous delivery (CI/CD) pipeline?**


**Speed & Quality a Win-Win Situation-** Because of the shortened code commit cycles produced by a CI/CD pipeline, merge conflicts are reduced, saving a significant amount of workdays. Because release cycles are shorter, operations teams can put new features into use more quickly. Time-to-market for new items is shortened, allowing your company to operate at top speed without sacrificing quality. Quality and cooperation both improve.
<br>

**Increases your Team's efficiency—** Once you implement a CI/CD pipeline, the manual tasks of your DevOps team are almost eliminated. Testing, change deployment, and code merging are all automated. All the time, your code is release-ready, and you catch the majority of issues before they are implemented by avoiding coding errors.
<br>

**Cost-Cutting and Savings-** Automation make actions less prone to human error. Your team doesn't have to spend time repairing bugs because the code is constantly committed. The costs of developing and testing software or applications are all but gone. Software development costs are greatly decreased when a CI/CD pipeline is put in place.
<br>

**Improved Code Quality-**  Because the code is managed in smaller portions, it is constantly fully tested. Rapid and automatic problem isolation lowers the possibility of unintended repercussions in the production environment. Finding a serious bug after release is significantly less likely. This indicates that your clients are more content and satisfied with your goods.
<br>

**Happy & Satisfied Customers-** A CI/CD pipeline is a fantastic method to avoid squandering the initial impression you make on consumers. Your clients will remain satisfied if you release new features and bug fixes quickly. You attract new clients who will choose you over the competition because of great evaluations as you maintain your app updated with the newest technologies. Customer happiness rises as a result of better apps.
<br>

**Reduced Backlogs-** You can cut down on the number of non-critical problems in your backlog by using a simple CI/CD pipeline. It's simple since they are found before production begins and repaired before the program is published. You have more time to concentrate on bigger issues, along with your core developers, when you have a reduced backlog.


<br>

**How to implement CI/CD for your startup?**
<br>

There are various ways to build up your CI/CD pipeline. Every business is unique, and every startup has different objectives and resources. To make the best use of CI/CD, get it specifically tailored to match the demands of your company and its projects.
