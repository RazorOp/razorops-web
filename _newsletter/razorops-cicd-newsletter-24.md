 Docker, Inc. plans to embed the ability to dynamically generate a software bill of materials (SBOM) using the Docker Build command that developers use to build Docker images. Company CEO Scott Johnston says existing SBOM tools can't keep pace with the rate at which developers are ripping and replacing containers.


Atomist, a container vulnerability detection tool vendor that will be integrated with Docker Build, was recently bought by Docker Inc. The end goal is to gather SBOMs and evaluate them proactively so that businesses can accept or reject applications depending on the components being used. The integration of SBOM capabilities by Docker Inc. will make it easier for development teams to identify and fix problems. <a href="https://containerjournal.com/features/docker-inc-to-integrate-free-sbom-generation-tool/" target="_blank"><b>Read the full article.</b></a>

Zero Trust is a framework that, in addition to a change in culture, involves a variety of tools, processes, and technology to be effective. Every identity in the Zero Trust paradigm is assumed to be malicious until proven otherwise. The CNCF advises taking into account platform-based pod policies, network policies, packaging, and container image architecture when implementing zero trust in a Kubernetes context.
