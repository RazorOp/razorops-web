Why Do We Need Kubernetes? In Docker, we maintain containers on the machines but what if the machines get crashed and we are not able to access that content? Here is the role of Kubernetes. Kubernetes forms a cluster in which it has several machines connected, and on top of that cluster, the containers are used. The advantage of this is if any machines go down there will be other machines that serve the container.
