**A Kubernetes-Native Service Mesh with Optional Sidecars**

The vision for Cilium Service Mesh is a service mesh built using native Kubernetes resources, just like Cilium’s ClusterMesh uses Kubernetes Services and NetworkPolicy to perform multi-cluster connectivity. Today we are announcing the availability of the first stable release of a new exciting option to run Cilium as a service mesh completely without sidecars while supporting a variety of different control plane options. It complements the already existing sidecar-based Istio integration that has been available as part of Cilium so far.
