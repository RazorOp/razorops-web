**[The Kubernetes project has released version 1.24 of Stargazer](https://kubernetes.io/blog/2022/05/03/kubernetes-1-24-release-announcement/)**, its ubiquitous container orchestration system — the first release of 2022 and just in time for KubeCon Europe, which starts on May 16th. **[The Dockershim code, which was deprecated in version 1.20](https://kubernetes.io/blog/2020/12/02/dockershim-faq/)** (issued at the end of 2020), has now been deleted. There are 46 enhancements in this release: fourteen have been promoted to stable, fifteen have been promoted to beta, and thirteen have been promoted to alpha. Two features have also been deprecated, while two have been eliminated.

**[Kubernetes 1.24 ‘Stargazer’ release removes Dockershim and adds OpenAPI v3 in beta.](https://github.com/kubernetes/enhancements/issues/2896)**

The latest release of the Kubernetes container orchestration engine, nicknamed “Stargazer,” looks out to better support databases, microservices, and other emerging use cases, while shedding earlier missteps that have stymied the K8s core developers’ productivity. Containers built on the Docker development tools are now built to run on the CRI spec and are not affected by this change. “For most application developers, this will be a transparent change,” explained James Laverack, who is the project lead for the v1.24 release.


*“The community felt that removing it would allow that part of the codebase to be streamlined and reduce bugs, improve stability, and increase velocity for more releases,” Laverack said. “So it’s a foundational change that will help Kubernetes ship more features in the future with better quality.”*

**[How did Applozic, a real-time chat, and messaging platform, accelerate its software delivery with RazorOps?](https://bit.ly/3KUGK1b)**

Applozic, being a Real-Time Chat and Messaging platform, needed faster iterations and quicker deliveries to end customers. Continuous integration (CI) and continuous delivery (CD) provide for faster iterations, shorter time to value for consumers, debugging isolation, and root-cause analysis. CI/CD allows software development teams to focus on solving business needs while assuring code quality and security.

Kubernetes is an open-source project that was founded by Google and is now being developed as a multi-stakeholder initiative under the Linux Foundation's Cloud Native Computing Foundation (CNCF). Kubernetes enables enterprises to deploy, manage, and scale application container workloads in an automated, policy-driven way. It's a method that enables hybrid and multi-cloud computing by spanning Kubernetes workloads across on-premises and many public cloud environments. Read about some of the most significant factors to consider when looking for a Kubernetes platform.
