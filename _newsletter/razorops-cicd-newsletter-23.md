 Hexa Open Source Project for Multi-Cloud Policy Orchestration Accepted as a CNCF Sandbox Project. Open Source Identity Standard and Policy Orchestration Software Unifies Multi-Cloud Access Policy Management.

<br>
***“Cloud Identity is extremely fragmented with no clear path for orchestrating policy management across different service provider platforms,”*** said Gary Rowe, principal consulting analyst, and CEO of TechVision Research. ***“IDQL represents a major step forward in providing a standards-based approach for cloud-based IAM governance.”***

<br>
The vision for this new project is to usher in a well-conceived open-source policy orchestration framework that expands the possibilities for businesses, consumers, and software vendors to benefit from the transition to a modern, transparent, and passwordless approach to identity. <a href="https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20220913005502/en/Hexa-Open-Source-Project-for-Multi-Cloud-Policy-Orchestration-Accepted-as-CNCF-Sandbox-Project" target="_blank"><b>Read the full article.</b></a>

Continuous Delivery (CD) builds on top of Continuous Integration (CI) and automates both builds and the complete software release process. A software release artifact can move and advance through the pipeline with a CI/CD pipeline, starting from the code check-in stage through the builds, tests, and different deployment stages.
