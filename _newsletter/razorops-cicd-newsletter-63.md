Organization to thrive and to compete in an ever-changing and agile technology environment, developers should utilise continuous integration and continuous delivery (CI/CD). Releases must be delivered quickly in weeks, days or as needed with mature and well-organised DevOps strategies.

CI/CD is part of DevOps, the collection of philosophies, practices, teams and tools designed to significantly improve an organization’s pace of delivering scalable applications and services. Developing best practices with DevOps helps ensure efficiencies and extensibility as software platforms expect to support microservices architecture, containers and cloud technologies.

And not only do CI/CD workflows help your software development team complete tasks and projects 

CI/CD (Continuous Integration/Continuous Deployment) pipelines are an integral part of modern software development practices, enabling organizations to streamline their development, testing, and deployment processes. CI/CD pipelines offer several benefits, and Progress Professional Services can help businesses effectively implement and optimize their CI/CD pipelines. Here are the key benefits and the role of Progress Professional Services in this context

**Increased Efficiency and Speed:** CI/CD pipelines automate the building, testing, and deployment of software, reducing manual effort and eliminating potential errors. This automation enables faster development cycles, as code changes are automatically validated and deployed. Progress Professional Services can assist businesses in setting up efficient CI/CD pipelines, leveraging industry best practices and tools to streamline the entire development process.

<b>Faster Time-to-Market:</b> With CI/CD pipelines, organizations can release software updates and new features more frequently. The automation and integration of various stages in the pipeline allow for faster feedback loops, enabling developers to quickly identify and fix issues. Progress Professional Services can help organizations implement CI/CD practices tailored to their specific needs, reducing time-to-market and enabling rapid innovation.

**Improved Quality and Reliability:** CI/CD pipelines enforce a rigorous testing process, running automated tests at every stage of the pipeline. This ensures that code changes are thoroughly tested and validated, reducing the likelihood of introducing bugs or regressions into the software. Progress Professional Services can assist in designing and implementing comprehensive testing strategies within the CI/CD pipeline, including unit tests, integration tests, and automated functional tests.

**Enhanced Collaboration and Communication:** CI/CD pipelines encourage collaboration between development, testing, and operations teams. By automating the build and deployment processes, CI/CD pipelines enable seamless integration between teams, reducing bottlenecks and facilitating communication. Progress Professional Services can help organisations establish effective collaboration practices, aligning teams and enabling cross-functional collaboration within the CI/CD pipeline.

**Continuous Feedback and Improvement:** CI/CD pipelines provide real-time feedback on code quality, test results, and deployment status. This feedback loop enables developers to identify issues early and make iterative improvements, leading to higher-quality software. Progress Professional Services can assist in implementing monitoring and feedback mechanisms within the CI/CD pipeline, allowing organisations to gather actionable insights and continuously improve their development practices.

**Infrastructure as Code and DevOps Enablement:** CI/CD pipelines often integrate with infrastructure-as-code tools, enabling the provisioning and management of infrastructure resources alongside code deployments. This alignment of development and operations practices, known as DevOps, promotes collaboration, automation, and faster deployments. Progress Professional Services can guide organisations in adopting DevOps principles and help integrate infrastructure-as-code practices into their CI/CD pipelines.

**Customised CI/CD Solutions:** Progress Professional Services can provide tailored CI/CD solutions to meet specific business requirements. They can assess the organisation's existing development processes, infrastructure, and tools, and design a CI/CD pipeline that aligns with the organisation's goals. Progress Professional Services can also assist in migrating legacy applications to a CI/CD pipeline or optimising existing pipelines for improved efficiency and effectiveness.

The benefits of CI/CD pipelines from designing and implementing CI/CD workflows to optimizing testing strategies and enabling DevOps practices, Progress Professional Services can help businesses achieve faster, more reliable software development and deployment processes.

## But First, What is CI/CD?

* Continuous Integration (CI) is a software engineering methodology where development team members frequently integrate their various projects through automation. A software team using CI usually relies on automation tooling, which empowers teams to build, test and merge code seamlessly and without hassle.

* On the other end of the development spectrum is continuous delivery (CD). Continuous delivery is when software is always ready to be deployed. While using an automation tool, continuous delivery involves slowly releasing code in increments. This methodology is safer than releasing all the code and updates simultaneously so that any problems can be detected earlier in the process.

* Alternatively, CD can stand for continuous deployment, often called “push button” deployment. Continuous deployment enables development teams to place new software releases into production, using automation and a scheduled time. Continuous deployment can also be used on-demand, if the developers require it. It should be noted that continuous deployment is only available once a fully-baked DevOps practice has been implemented.

* Whether CD stands for continuous delivery or deployment, the process goes hand in hand with CI. When integrating the two processes, developers create a repeatable workflow within the pipeline where one task flows into the next. The concept of iterating, testing and validating is important in that it offers an opportunity to provide feedback during critical points and undo specific tasks when failures occur.

* CI/CD pipelines generally start with the source code and track the journey through the commit, build and test phases, eventually moving to the production environment.

* Every CI/CD pipeline starts with smaller phases, the first phase being continuous integration and the second one being continuous development or deployment.

## How a CI/CD Pipeline Can Benefit Your DevOps Team and Organization

* Building and using automation ensures efficiency, speeds up build cycles and fewer humans need to be involved.

* Automation enables faster feedback loops in cases of code defects—identification of defects and logging results in quicker resolution.

* Quality dashboards provide complete visibility and a complete view into built results. Using automated static Code Analysis rules, software such as SonarQube can help validate coding standards, best practices, security vulnerabilities and performance pitfalls.

* Confidence in code quality and repeatable processes enables faster release cycles.

* Developers can focus on their work and spend less energy on the CI process.

* Combining test automation and other CI benefits allows for more development focus, resulting in better quality.

* The resulting builds can be auto-deployed to the target server as desired through a CI server.
