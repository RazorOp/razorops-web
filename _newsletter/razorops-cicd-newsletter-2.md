[Kubernetes is gaining mainstream recognition and starting to go " Under the Hood"](https://www.cncf.io/reports/cncf-annual-survey-2021/) states [CNCF Annual Survey Report 2021](https://www.cncf.io/reports/cncf-annual-survey-2021/). Kubernetes has crossed the adoption chasm to become a mainstream global technology. According to CNCF’s respondents, 96% of organizations are either using or evaluating Kubernetes – a record high since our surveys began in 2016.
