20. **Explain log levels and their significance.**
    - **Answer:** Log levels (e.g., DEBUG, INFO, WARN, ERROR) indicate the severity of events, helping prioritize issues during troubleshooting.


21. **What is anomaly detection in monitoring?**
    - **Answer:** Anomaly detection identifies unusual patterns or deviations in system metrics, potentially signaling issues.

22. **Describe how Prometheus scrapes metrics.**
    - **Answer:** Prometheus pulls metrics from configured endpoints (targets) at regular intervals, storing them as time-series data.

23. **How do you monitor containerized applications?**
    - **Answer:** By using tools like Prometheus with exporters for container metrics or specialized tools like cAdvisor or Kubernetes metrics.

24. **What is the purpose of alert thresholds?**
    - **Answer:** Alert thresholds define the values at which an alert should trigger, based on normal versus critical levels for monitored metrics.

25. **How do you scale monitoring for high-traffic applications?**
    - **Answer:** By using distributed monitoring systems, reducing data retention for less-critical metrics, and leveraging cloud-based solutions.

26. **What is OpenTelemetry?**
    - **Answer:** OpenTelemetry is a standardized framework for generating, collecting, and exporting telemetry data (logs, metrics, and traces).

27. **Explain the term “data retention policy” in logging.**
    - **Answer:** Data retention policy specifies how long log data is stored, balancing cost and compliance requirements.

28. **How does a push-based monitoring system work?**
    - **Answer:** In a push-based system, agents or applications push metrics to the monitoring server, unlike pull-based systems like Prometheus.

29. **What is metric granularity, and why is it important?**
    - **Answer:** Granularity refers to the precision of metric data, affecting detail and storage requirements. Finer granularity offers more detail but increases storage costs.

30. **Explain the concept of log correlation.**
    - **Answer:** Log correlation involves linking related log events across services or components, providing context to analyze complex incidents.
