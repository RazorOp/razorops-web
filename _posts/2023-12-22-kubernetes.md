### **What is Kubernetes**
<br>
Kubernetes (also known as k8s or “kube”) is an open source container orchestration platform that automates many of the manual processes involved in deploying, managing, and scaling containerized applications
<br>
<br>

* The origin, functions, and benefits of Kubernetes.
<br>

* Basics of modern application development and container management and orchestration.
<br>

* A look at basic Kubernetes architecture.
<br>

* Factors for you to consider when adopting Kubernetes.
<br>

* Information about how Red Hat OpenShift can help you simplify and scale Kubernetes applications.
<br>
<br>

### **What is a Kubernetes cluster**
<br>
A working Kubernetes deployment is called a cluster, which is a group of hosts running Linux containers. You can visualize a Kubernetes cluster as two parts: the control plane and the compute machines, or nodes.
<br>
<br>

Each node is its own Linux environment, and could be either a physical or virtual machine. Each node runs pods, which are made up of containers. 
<br>
<br>

The control plane is responsible for maintaining the desired state of the cluster, such as which applications are running and which container images they use. Compute machines actually run the applications and workloads. The control plane takes commands from an administrator (or DevOps team) and relays those instructions to the compute machines.
<br>
<br>

This handoff works with a multitude of services to automatically decide which node is best suited for the task. Services decouple work definitions from the pods and automatically get service requests to the right pod—no matter where it moves in the cluster or even if it’s been replaced. It allocates resources and assigns the pods in that node to fulfil the requested work.
<br>
<br>

Kubernetes runs on top of an operating system Red Hat Enterprise Linux, and interacts with pods of containers running on the nodes.
<br>
<br>

The desired state of a Kubernetes cluster defines which applications or other workloads should be running, along with which images they use, which resources should be made available to them, and other such configuration details.
<br>
<br>

There is little change to how you manage containers using this type of infrastructure. Your involvement just happens at a higher level, giving you better control without the need to micromanage each separate container or node.
<br>
<br>

Where you run Kubernetes is up to you. This can be on bare metal servers, virtual machines (VMs), public cloud providers, private clouds, and hybrid cloud environments. One of Kubernetes’ key advantages is it works on many different kinds of infrastructure.
<br>
<br>

### **$1000+ Free Cloud Credits to Deploy Clusters**

### **What are Kubernetes labels**
<br>
Kubernetes labels are key-value string pairs that link identifying metadata to Kubernetes objects. Kubernetes provides teams with integrated support for using labels to retrieve and filter the data from the Kubernetes API and carry out bulk operations on the selected objects.
<br>
<br>

Many teams use Kubernetes labels to provide DevOps with information about the ownership of a node, a pod, or other Kubernetes objects for easier tracking and operational decision-making.
<br>
<br>

When creating a new label, you must comply with the restrictions Kubernetes places on the length and allowed values. A label value must:
<br>
<br>

* Contain 63 characters or less (a label’s value can also be empty),
<br>

* Start and end with an alphanumeric character (unless it’s empty),
<br>

* Only include dashes (-), underscores (_), dots (.), and alphanumerics
<br>

### **What is Kubernetes used for?**
<br>
Kubernetes can help you deliver and manage containerized, legacy, and cloud-native apps, as well as those being refactored into microservices.
<br>
<br>

In order to meet changing business needs, your development team needs to be able to rapidly build new applications and services. Cloud-native development starts with microservices in containers, which enables faster development and makes it easier to transform and optimize existing applications.
<br>
<br>

### **Application development with Kubernetes**
<br>

Production apps span multiple containers, and those containers must be deployed across multiple server hosts. Kubernetes gives you the orchestration and management capabilities required to deploy containers, at scale, for these workloads.
<br>
<br>

Kubernetes orchestration allows you to build application services that span multiple containers, schedule those containers across a cluster, scale those containers, and manage the health of those containers over time. With Kubernetes you can take effective steps toward better IT security.
<br>
<br>

Kubernetes also needs to integrate with networking, storage, security, telemetry, and other services to provide a comprehensive container infrastructure.
<br>
<br>

### **Kubernetes explained - diagram**
<br>

Once you scale this to a production environment and multiple applications, it's clear that you need multiple, colocated containers working together to deliver the individual services.
<br>
<br>

Linux containers give your microservice-based apps an ideal application deployment unit and self-contained execution environment. And microservices in containers make it easier to orchestrate services, including storage, networking, and security.
<br>
<br>

This significantly multiplies the number of containers in your environment, and as those containers accumulate, the complexity also grows.
<br>
<br>

Kubernetes fixes a lot of common problems with container proliferation by sorting containers together into "pods." Pods add a layer of abstraction to grouped containers, which helps you schedule workloads and provide necessary services—like networking and storage—to those containers.
<br>
<br>

Other parts of Kubernetes help you balance loads across these pods and ensure you have the right number of containers running to support your workloads.
<br>
<br>

With the right implementation of Kubernetes and with the help of other open source projects like Open vSwitch, OAuth, and SELinux you can orchestrate all parts of your container infrastructure.

<br>

* **Multi-Region Deployments:** Consider deploying clusters in multiple regions for added resilience.
<br>
<br>

**Service Discovery and Load Balancing:** Kubernetes provides built-in mechanisms for service discovery and load balancing, ensuring efficient communication between microservices.
<br>
<br>

### **Load Balancer in kubernetes**
<br>

In Kubernetes, a Load Balancer is a crucial component for distributing network traffic across multiple pods or nodes to ensure high availability and optimal resource utilization. Kubernetes provides an abstraction for load balancing through the Service resource.
<br>
<br>

### **Service Resource:**
<br>

* **Type LoadBalancer:** When you create a Kubernetes Service and specify its type as LoadBalancer, Kubernetes interacts with the underlying cloud provider (e.g., AWS, Azure, GCP) to provision a load balancer.
<br>
<br>

### **Load Balancer Provisioning:**
<br>

* **External IP:** The cloud provider assigns an external IP address to the LoadBalancer Service, which is used to route external traffic.
<br>
<br>

* **Port Configuration:** You can configure the load balancer to forward traffic on specific ports to the corresponding ports on the pods.
<br>
<br>

### **NodePort and ClusterIP:**
<br>

* **NodePort:** Alternatively, you can expose services using NodePort, which opens a specific port on each node and forwards traffic to the service.
<br>
<br>

* **ClusterIP:** Services can also be exposed using ClusterIP, which provides an internal IP that is accessible only within the cluster.
<br>
<br>

### **Routing Traffic:**
<br>

* **Service Discovery:** Kubernetes uses DNS to provide a hostname for the LoadBalancer, allowing clients to discover the IP addresses of the pods.
<br>
<br>

* **Round Robin or Session Affinity:** The Load Balancer can distribute traffic in a round-robin fashion or use session affinity to route requests from the same client to the same pod.
<br>
<br>

### **Health Checks:**
<br>

* **Readiness and Liveness Probes:** Define probes to check the readiness and liveness of individual pods. The Load Balancer can avoid routing traffic to unhealthy pods.
<br>
<br>

### **Annotations and Configuration:**
<br>

* **Annotations:** Cloud-specific annotations can be used to configure advanced settings on the load balancer, such as SSL termination, connection draining, or custom timeouts.
<br>
<br>

### **External DNS:**
<br>

* **Integration with External DNS Services:** Integrate the LoadBalancer Service with external DNS services to map a custom domain to the dynamically assigned external IP.
<br>
<br>

### **Ingress Controllers:**
<br>

* **Ingress Resources:** For more advanced routing and configuration, Ingress resources can be used with Ingress controllers. Ingress provides a way to expose HTTP and HTTPS routes to services.
<br>
<br>

* **Ingress Controllers:** Third-party or cloud-specific Ingress controllers manage the external load balancer and handle routing based on Ingress rules.
<br>
<br>

### **Securing Traffic:**
<br>

* **TLS Termination:** Configure TLS termination at the LoadBalancer level for secure communication.
<br>
<br>

* **Network Policies:** Implement network policies to control and secure communication between pods.
<br>
<br>

### **Scaling and Availability:**
<br>

* **Scaling:** As the number of pods or nodes changes, the Load Balancer adapts to the new configuration.
<br>
<br>

* **High Availability:** Load Balancers themselves are designed to be highly available, providing redundancy and failover mechanisms.
<br>
<br>

### **Cost Considerations:**
<br>

* **Cost Management:** Depending on the cloud provider, there may be costs associated with LoadBalancer resources. Be mindful of cost considerations, especially in large deployments.
<br>
<br>

**Monitoring and Logging:** Learn about Kubernetes-native tools like Prometheus and Grafana for monitoring cluster health, resource usage, and application performance.
