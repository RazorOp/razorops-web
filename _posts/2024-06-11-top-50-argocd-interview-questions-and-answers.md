**1.  What is ArgoCD?**
    

ArgoCD is a declarative, GitOps continuous delivery tool for Kubernetes.

**2.  How does ArgoCD work?**
    

ArgoCD continuously monitors Git repositories and ensures the desired state of the application matches the state in the repository.

**3.  What are the main features of ArgoCD?**
    

GitOps-based deployment, support for multiple environments, automated synchronization, health status, rollbacks, and self-healing.

**4.  What is GitOps?**
    

GitOps is a practice of using Git repositories as the source of truth for declarative infrastructure and applications.

**5.  How does ArgoCD integrate with Kubernetes?**
    

ArgoCD operates as a Kubernetes controller that continuously compares the desired application state defined in Git with the live state on the cluster.

####   

**6.  How do you install ArgoCD?**
    

You can install ArgoCD using the provided manifests from the official ArgoCD repository, typically with kubectl apply -n argocd -f <manifest_url>.

**7.  What are the prerequisites for installing ArgoCD?**
    

A Kubernetes cluster, kubectl installed, and appropriate access rights to install and manage resources on the cluster.

**8.  How do you access the ArgoCD UI?**
    

You can port-forward the ArgoCD server service to your local machine using kubectl port-forward svc/argocd-server -n argocd 8080:443 and then access it via https://localhost:8080.

**9.  How do you authenticate to ArgoCD?**
    

The initial password for the admin user is the name of the ArgoCD server pod. This can be changed after the first login.

**10.  How do you configure ArgoCD to connect to a Git repository?**
    

Through the ArgoCD UI, CLI, or declarative configurations where you define the repository credentials in the ArgoCD settings.

####   

**11.  How do you create an application in ArgoCD?**
    

Applications can be created via the ArgoCD UI, CLI (argocd app create), or by defining an Application custom resource.

**12.  What are the key components of an ArgoCD Application resource?**
    

spec.source for the repository location, spec.destination for the target cluster and namespace, and spec.project for project association.

**13.  What is ApplicationSet in ArgoCD?**
    

An ApplicationSet is a CRD that allows you to create multiple ArgoCD Applications based on a template and a generator.

**14.  How do you synchronize an application?**
    

Synchronization can be done manually via the UI, CLI, or automatically if auto-sync is configured in the application spec.

**15.  What are the different sync policies in ArgoCD?**
    

Manual sync, auto-sync, prune, and self-healing.

####   

**16.  What is a sync wave in ArgoCD?**
    

Sync waves allow you to control the order in which Kubernetes manifests are applied during a sync operation.

**17.  How do you handle sync failures in ArgoCD?**
    

Sync failures can be handled by configuring retry policies or manually troubleshooting and resolving the issues.

**18.  What are health checks in ArgoCD?**
    

Health checks determine the health status of Kubernetes resources, ensuring they are in the desired state.

**19.  How do you define custom health checks?**
    

Custom health checks can be defined in the argocd-cm ConfigMap using Lua scripts.

**20.  How do you perform a rollback in ArgoCD?**
    

Rollbacks can be performed via the UI or CLI by selecting a previous application revision.

####   

**21.  How do you configure RBAC in ArgoCD?**
    

RBAC is configured using policies defined in the argocd-rbac-cm ConfigMap.

**22.  What roles are available in ArgoCD?**
    

Predefined roles include role:admin, role:edit, role:read, and custom roles can be defined as needed.

**23.  How do you secure ArgoCD?**
    

By configuring HTTPS, using strong authentication methods, limiting access via RBAC, and regularly updating ArgoCD.

**24.  Can ArgoCD integrate with SSO?**
    

Yes, ArgoCD supports SSO integration with providers like OAuth2, OIDC, SAML, and LDAP.

**25.  What is the purpose of the argocd-cm ConfigMap?**
    

The argocd-cm ConfigMap stores the main configuration settings for ArgoCD, including repository credentials, sync policies, and more.

####   

**26.  How do you manage multiple clusters with ArgoCD?**
    

Multiple clusters are managed by registering them in the argocd-cm ConfigMap and specifying the target cluster in the application spec.

**27.  What are ArgoCD projects?**
    

Projects are a way to group applications, enforce policies, and manage access control within ArgoCD.

**28.  How do you define a project in ArgoCD?**
    

Projects are defined using the AppProject custom resource.

**29.  How do you restrict resource usage per project?**
    

Resource usage can be restricted by defining quotas and allowed namespaces in the AppProject spec.

**30.  What is ArgoCD’s HA mode?**
    

HA mode ensures high availability by deploying multiple replicas of ArgoCD components and using a highly available backend database.

####   

**31.  How do you debug sync issues in ArgoCD?**
    

By reviewing the application’s sync history, logs, and events through the UI or CLI.

**32.  What are common causes of sync failures?**
    

Incorrect resource definitions, missing dependencies, insufficient permissions, and misconfigured Git repository access.

**33.  How do you view ArgoCD logs?**
    

Logs can be viewed using kubectl logs for ArgoCD pods or through the ArgoCD UI.

**34.  How do you handle application drift?**
    

Drift is detected by ArgoCD and can be corrected by synchronizing the application to match the desired state in the Git repository.

**35.  What is the difference between argocd app sync and argocd app refresh?**
    

argocd app sync triggers a synchronization of the application, while argocd app refresh updates the application state from the Git repository without syncing.

####   

**36.  How do you integrate ArgoCD with CI/CD pipelines?**
    

By using webhooks to trigger deployments or by including ArgoCD CLI commands in the pipeline scripts.

**37.  What is an ArgoCD webhook?**
    

Webhooks are HTTP callbacks that notify ArgoCD of changes in the Git repository, triggering application synchronization.

**38.  How do you configure webhooks in ArgoCD?**
    

Webhooks are configured in the Git repository settings, pointing to the ArgoCD webhook receiver URL.

**39.  Can ArgoCD manage Helm charts?**
    

Yes, ArgoCD can deploy and manage applications defined as Helm charts.

**40.  How do you handle secrets in ArgoCD?**
    

Secrets can be managed using tools like Sealed Secrets, HashiCorp Vault, or Kubernetes secrets.

####   

**41.  How do you scale ArgoCD?**
    

By increasing the number of replicas for ArgoCD components and using a distributed backend database.

**42.  What is the ArgoCD Application Controller?**
    

The Application Controller is responsible for reconciling the desired and live state of applications managed by ArgoCD.

**43.  How do you optimize ArgoCD performance?**
    

By using caching, optimizing Git repository structure, and tuning resource limits and requests.

**44.  What are resource limits and requests in ArgoCD?**
    

Resource limits and requests are Kubernetes settings that control the CPU and memory resources allocated to ArgoCD components.

**45.  How does ArgoCD handle large Git repositories?**
    

By using shallow cloning, caching, and configuring Git depth.

####   

**46.  What are some best practices for using ArgoCD?**
    

Use Git as the single source of truth, define clear sync policies, manage secrets securely, and implement robust RBAC.

**47.  How do you ensure continuous delivery with ArgoCD?**
    

By using automated sync policies, health checks, and integrating ArgoCD with CI/CD pipelines.

**48.  What are some common pitfalls when using ArgoCD?**
    

Misconfigured sync policies, insufficient RBAC settings, neglecting to monitor ArgoCD components, and not handling secrets properly.

**49.  How do you backup and restore ArgoCD?**
    

By backing up the ArgoCD database and configurations and restoring them in case of failure.
