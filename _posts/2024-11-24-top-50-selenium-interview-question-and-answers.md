5.  **What are the limitations of Selenium?**
    
    -   Cannot test desktop applications
    -   No in-built reporting feature
    -   Requires third-party tools for complete automation testing (e.g., for capturing screenshots).


6.  **What is Selenium WebDriver?**  
    Selenium WebDriver is an API that interacts with web browsers to automate browser actions like clicking, typing, and navigation.
    
7.  **How do you start a browser session in Selenium?**
  
    
    `WebDriver driver = new ChromeDriver();` 
    
8.  **What is the difference between `driver.get()` and `driver.navigate().to()`?**
    
    -   `driver.get()`: Waits for the page to load completely.
    -   `driver.navigate().to()`: Does not wait for page load.
9.  **How do you handle browser windows in Selenium?**  
    Use `driver.getWindowHandles()` to get all open windows' handles and switch using `driver.switchTo().window(handle)`.
    
10.  **How do you handle alerts in Selenium?**
   

     `Alert alert = driver.switchTo().alert();
alert.accept(); // To accept the alert` 


11.  **How do you find elements in Selenium?**  
    Using locators like:

-   `id`
-   `name`
-   `className`
-   `tagName`
-   `cssSelector`
-   `xpath`

12.  **What is the difference between `findElement()` and `findElements()`?**

-   `findElement()`: Returns the first matching element or throws an exception if none is found.
-   `findElements()`: Returns a list of matching elements or an empty list if none are found.

13.  **What are XPath and its types?**  
    XPath is a syntax used to navigate through elements in an XML document.

-   **Absolute XPath**: Starts from the root (`/`).
-   **Relative XPath**: Starts from any element (`//`).

14.  **How do you handle dynamic elements in Selenium?**  
    Use dynamic XPath expressions like:

     `//*[contains(@id, 'dynamic-part')]` 

15.  **How do you perform mouse hover actions in Selenium?**

`Actions actions = new Actions(driver);
actions.moveToElement(element).perform();` 


16.  **What is the Page Object Model (POM)?**  
    POM is a design pattern where web pages are represented as classes, and elements are defined as variables in those classes.
    
17.  **What is a Fluent Wait in Selenium?**  
    Fluent Wait defines the maximum time to wait for a condition and the frequency with which to check the condition.
    
18.  **How do you handle frames in Selenium?**
   

     `driver.switchTo().frame("frameName");` 

19.  **What are Selenium Grid and its usage?**  
    Selenium Grid is used for parallel test execution across different machines and browsers.
    
20.  **What is the difference between implicit wait and explicit wait?**
    
-   **Implicit Wait**: Waits for a specified time for all elements globally.
-   **Explicit Wait**: Waits for a specific condition for a particular element.

21.  **How do you integrate Selenium with TestNG?**  
    By using annotations like `@Test`, `@BeforeTest`, and `@AfterTest` in TestNG.
    
22.  **What are the benefits of integrating Selenium with Jenkins?**
    
-   Continuous Integration and Continuous Deployment (CI/CD)
-   Automated execution of Selenium tests

23.  **How do you capture a screenshot in Selenium?**

     `File srcFile = ((TakesScreenshot) driver).getScreenshotAs(OutputType.FILE);` 

24.  **Can Selenium be used with other testing tools?**  
    Yes, Selenium can be integrated with JUnit, TestNG, Cucumber, and Appium.
    
25.  **How do you handle SSL certificates in Selenium?**  
    Use desired capabilities to accept insecure certificates.
    

     `DesiredCapabilities capabilities = new DesiredCapabilities();
         capabilities.setAcceptInsecureCerts(true);` 

26.  **What should you do if an element is not clickable?**

-   Scroll to the element using JavaScript.
-   Use explicit waits.

27.  **How do you handle stale element exceptions?**  
    Refresh the element using `findElement()` or retry the action.
    
28.  **What is the cause of a NoSuchElementException?**  
    The locator used does not match any element in the DOM.
    
29.  **How do you handle timeouts in Selenium?**  
    Use appropriate waits like `WebDriverWait` or increase the default timeout.
    
30.  **What is the cause of an ElementNotVisibleException?**  
    The element is present in the DOM but not visible on the UI.
    
31.  **How do you optimize Selenium test scripts?**

-   Use Page Object Model.
-   Minimize hard-coded waits.
-   Use reusable utility methods.

32.  **How do you handle CAPTCHA in Selenium?**  
    Use manual intervention or external tools like OCR.

46.  **What is a shadow DOM, and how do you handle it in Selenium?**
