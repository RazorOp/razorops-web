**What is AWS CodeBuild?**

Amazon codeBuild is a fully managed continuous integration service that helps developers to build and run test code rapidly. This service also provides test artifacts with great efficiency.

This gives an advantage to developers/DevOps engineers not to wait in long build queues, scaling, configuring, and maintaining build service. AWS CodeBuild runs continuously and avoids the wait time for concurrent jobs. Additionally, users pay only for the build time they use. In other words, the ideal time won’t be counted in billing time for the user.

**Features:**

1. Easy to Set up – Amazon CodeBuild is easy to set up for the developers. Either they can build their code build environment or use one of the preconfigured environments.

2. It works with existing tools such as Jenkins plugin, GIT, etc.

3. It can scale automatically with several concurrent builds.

4. Automated Build: Developers need to configure builds once and whenever there is a code change, CodeBuild service will automatically run and generate the test results.

5. Pay as you go which means developers are only charged for the time it takes to complete the build, idle time won’t be considered in billing.

**Pricing:**

Pricing will be computed based on the build minutes. The first 100 minutes of the build are free and then the rest will be charged based on each instance type usage.
