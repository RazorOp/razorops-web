**What is AWS X-Ray?**

AWS X-Ray helps to analyze and debug production systems in distributed environments. AWS X-Ray is a method used to profile and monitor applications, mostly built using microservice architecture.

Using X-Ray service features, it’s very easy for a user to troubleshoot and find the root cause of slowness of the system, including other performance-related errors.

**X-Ray components:**

● Daemon: a unique application that collects related segment data.

● Segments: provides resource names, requests information.

● Subsegments: This provides granular details about downstream calls.

● Service Graph: Visual representation of micro-service response or failure.

● Traces: Collects all segments created from a single request.

● Sampling: Algorithm which decides which request needs to be traced.

● Filter Expressions: easier to deep dive to understand the particular path.

**Features:**

● Supports all language (Go, NodeJS, Ruby, Java, Phyton, ASP.NET, PHP)

● It supports AWS service integration with Lambda, API Gateway, App Mesh, CloudTrail, CloudWatch, AWS Config, EB, ELB, SNS, SQS, EC2, ECS, Fargate.

● Helps in improving application performance.

● Easy to discover application issues with insights provided by X-Ray.

● It helps in tracking user requests as they travel through the entire application.

**Pricing:**

● Traces recorded/retrieved/scanned will cost $.50 per 1 million requests beyond the free tier.
