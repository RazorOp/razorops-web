**What is Amazon Neptune?**

Amazon Neptune is a graph database service used as a web service to build and run applications that require connected datasets.

  

The graph database engine helps to store billions of connections and provides milliseconds latency for querying them.

  

It offers a choice from graph models and languages for querying data.

● Property Graph (PG) model with Apache TinkerPop Gremlin graph traversal language,

● W3C standard Resource Description Framework (RDF) model with SPARQL Query Language.

  

It is highly available across three AZs and automatically fails over any of the 15 low latency read replicas.

  

It provides fault-tolerant storage by replicating two copies of data across three availability zones.

  

It provides continuous backup to Amazon S3 and point-in-time recovery from storage failures.

  

It automatically scales storage capacity and provides encryption at rest and in transit.
