**What is AWS Personal Health Dashboard?**

AWS Personal Health Dashboard is powered by the AWS Health API that provides alerts and remediation measures to diagnose and resolve issues related to AWS resources and infrastructure.

AWS Health provides continuous visibility into performance and the availability of the AWS services.

AWS offers two dashboards: AWS Service Health Dashboard and the Personal Health Dashboard.

● AWS Service Health Dashboard provides access to the current status and a complete health check of all services in all regions.

● The Personal Health Dashboard provides notification of any service interruptions that may affect the resources within the AWS account.

At the Personal Health Dashboard, there are three categories:

Open issues - shows issues of the last seven days.

Scheduled changes - shows items of any upcoming changes.

Other notifications.

AWS Personal Health Dashboard integrates with Amazon CloudWatch Events to create custom rules and specify targets such as AWS Lambda functions to enable
remediation actions.
