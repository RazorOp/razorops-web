100.  **How does CI/CD differ in traditional DevOps vs. MLOps?**

-   **Answer:**
    -   In **traditional DevOps**, CI/CD is focused on application code deployment and testing, whereas in **MLOps**, CI/CD includes managing not only the code but also data, model artifacts, and experiments.
    -   **MLOps pipelines** often require steps like data validation, model training, hyperparameter tuning, model evaluation, and model retraining, in addition to the typical code deployment processes.
    -   Versioning and reproducibility are more complex in **MLOps** due to the need to track both the model and the data used during training.
