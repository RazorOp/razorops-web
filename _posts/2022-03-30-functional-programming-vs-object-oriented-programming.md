Programming paradigms differ from one another based on their features and the style they support. Every programming has its fine share of advantages and disadvantages  so it is better to know where to use it before actually using it.Functional programming and object-oriented programming have very different approaches to programming. 
<br>
Lets a quick look into Functional programming and object-oriented programming.
<br>
<br>

**FUNCTIONAL PROGRAMMING**
<br>
Functional programming tries to combine everything in pure mathematical functions. It is  declarative programming. It is the foundation  to code organization  that exists in all higher-order programming paradigms. Developers often use functional programming declaratively rather than imperatively.

Here are some examples of programming paradigms that support functional programming:JavaScript, Python, Scala.

<br>

**Advantages of Functional programming:**
* It reduces complex problems into simple parts
* It makes debugging the code quicker.
* It helps us to solve problems in a simpler way.
* It improves modularity.
<br>

**Disadvantages of Functional programming:**
* Combining pure functions
* Recursion
* Mathematical terminology


<br>

**OBJECT ORIENTED PROGRAMMING**
<br>
Object Oriented programming (OOP) is a program that uses the concept of classes and objects. It is used to turn a software program into simple, reusable pieces of code.

Here are some of the object-oriented programming paradigms -JavaScript, C++, Java, and Python.
<br>
<br>

**Advantages of object oriented programming :**
* Reuse of code 
* data-centered design 
* easy to maintain and modify existing code
* Higher-quality software
<br>


**Disadvantages of object oriented programming :**
* Decreased performance.
* Complex code
* Larger program size

<br>

**DIFFERENCE :**
<br>
Object-oriented languages are used when you have a fixed set of requirements to build some functionality , and as your requirement changes, you add new functionality. This is  accomplished by adding new classes which extends the existing methods, and there will be no changes done on the existing class.

Functional languages are preferred when you have a fixed set of requirements, and as your code changes, you mainly add new operations on existing code. This can be achieved by adding new functions which compute with existing data, and the existing functions are left alone.

**Functional Programming VS OOP Programming:**
<br>


|                | Functional Programming | OOP Programming |
| :------- | :--------: | :--------: |
| Definition     | It focuses on using functions where each function has a specific task     | It is based on Objects and Classes     |
| Support     | Supports parallel programming     | Does not support parallel programming     |
| Data     | Uses immutable data     | Uses mutable data     |
| Order of Execution     | No particular order while execution     | Uses bottom-up approach      |
| Security     | Does not have Data Hiding     | Provides Data Hiding      |
| Access Specifiers     | Does not have any Access specifiers     | Provides Access Specifiers(Private,Public,Protected)     |
| Iteration    | Uses recursion      | Uses Loops     |

<br>

**Conclusion**
<br>
Functional Programming and Object-oriented programming are completely different programming paradigm.Despite of having different approaches, both of them are designed  to make the code efficient.Both programming paradigms have their own pros and cons.To have create more efficiency in the development, typically OOP is prefered, while for the creation of very complicated, scalable, and flexible software systems FP will work better.
