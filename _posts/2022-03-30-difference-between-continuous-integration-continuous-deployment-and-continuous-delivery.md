Continuous integration is a DevOps practice, where developers continuously integrate the code changes into a central repository. It most often refers to the build or the integration stage of the software release process.A continuous integration service helps to automatically build and run unit tests on the new code changes to find any errors instantly.

**ADVANTAGES OF CONTINUOUS INTEGRATION**
* Helps you to increase the software quality 
* It enables you to conduct repeatable testing.
* CI allows developers to work independently on different  features in parallel.
* It can increase visibility 

 

<br>
Continuous Deployment is a software process that uses automated testing to confirm if changes to a core code doesn't break the existing  functionality and it is stable, for instant autonomous deployment to a production environment.  With continuous deployment customers get the updates quicker which means developers also get the feedback faster which indicates there will be less pressure as small updates are pushed gradually compared to major updates not pushed that often.

**ADVANTAGES OF CONTINUOUS DEPLOYMENT**

* It enables you to increase overall productivity.
* It allows us to automate repetitive tasks.
* It provides a single view across all the environments.

Continuous delivery expands upon continuous integration by deploying all the code changes to the testing environment and later to the production environment after the build stage. When correctly implemented,this will allow developers to always have a deployment-ready build that has passed all the standardized test processes. It will help the developers to closely validate the changes and discover any new issues. With continuous delivery, you can choose when to deploy like daily, weekly, fortnightly, or whatever best suits the business requirements.

The Key difference between continuous delivery and continuous deployment is that , continuous delivery needs the presence of a manual approval to update to production. With continuous deployment, production happens automatically without explicit approval. 

<br>
<br>

**ADVANTAGES OF CONTINUOUS DELIVERY**
* Automate the software release process which makes software delivery more efficient and quick
* It helps you to find bugs earlier in the delivery process.
* CD allows to deliver updates to immediately and frequently to clients/customers
