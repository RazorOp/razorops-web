1.  **What is Kubernetes?**  
    Kubernetes is an open-source container orchestration platform designed to automate the deployment, scaling, and management of containerized applications.
    
2.  **What is a Kubernetes Pod?**  
    A pod is the smallest deployable unit in Kubernetes, typically containing one or more containers with shared storage and network resources.
    
3.  **What are the main components of Kubernetes architecture?**
    
    -   Master Node (API Server, Controller Manager, Scheduler, etcd)
    -   Worker Nodes (Kubelet, Kube-Proxy, Container Runtime)
4.  **What is etcd in Kubernetes?**  
    `etcd` is a distributed key-value store that stores the cluster state and configuration data, enabling Kubernetes to maintain cluster consistency.
    
5.  **What is the role of a Kubelet?**  
    The Kubelet is an agent on each node that ensures containers are running as expected and manages pod operations.
    
6.  **Explain the Kubernetes API Server.**  
    The API server is the frontend for the Kubernetes control plane, handling REST requests to manage and retrieve the state of resources.
    
7.  **What is a Namespace in Kubernetes?**  
    A namespace is a virtual cluster within Kubernetes, used to divide cluster resources between multiple users or teams.
    
8.  **How does Kubernetes handle networking?**  
    Kubernetes uses networking models such as CNI plugins (like Calico, Flannel) to provide a flat network for communication between pods.
    
9.  **What is a Service in Kubernetes?**  
    A Service is an abstract way to expose an application running in a set of pods as a network service, providing stable access.
    
10.  **What is a ReplicaSet?**  
    A ReplicaSet ensures a specified number of pod replicas are running at all times, aiding in load balancing and availability.
    



11.  **What is a StatefulSet?**  
    StatefulSet manages stateful applications, where each pod has a unique identifier and stable, persistent storage.
    
12.  **Explain DaemonSet in Kubernetes.**  
    A DaemonSet ensures that a copy of a pod runs on all or specific nodes, commonly used for logging and monitoring.
    
13.  **What is a Persistent Volume (PV)?**  
    PV is a storage resource in a cluster, allowing pods to store data beyond their lifecycle.
    
14.  **What is a Persistent Volume Claim (PVC)?**  
    PVC is a request for storage by a user, which binds to a PV to meet the claimâ€™s specified storage needs.
    
15.  **How does Horizontal Pod Autoscaling work?**  
    Horizontal Pod Autoscaler adjusts the number of pod replicas based on CPU/memory metrics, improving resource utilization.
    
16.  **What is Ingress in Kubernetes?**  
    Ingress is an API object that manages external access to services, typically HTTP/HTTPS, providing routing rules.
    
17.  **Explain ConfigMap in Kubernetes.**  
    ConfigMap allows external configuration of application settings without rebuilding images.
    
18.  **What is Secret in Kubernetes?**  
    A Secret is an object that stores sensitive information, like passwords, in a secure and base64-encoded format.
    
19.  **What are Labels in Kubernetes?**  
    Labels are key-value pairs attached to objects like pods, used for organizing and selecting subsets of objects.
    
20.  **Explain Taints and Tolerations.**  
    Taints and tolerations work together to control which pods can run on specific nodes.
    



21.  **What is Helm?**  
    Helm is a package manager for Kubernetes, used to manage, install, and update applications as charts.
    
22.  **Explain Node Affinity.**  
    Node affinity allows scheduling constraints on which pods can run on specific nodes based on labels.
    
23.  **What is a Custom Resource Definition (CRD)?**  
    CRD allows users to define custom resources that extend the Kubernetes API.
    
24.  **What is the role of the Scheduler?**  
    The Scheduler assigns pods to nodes based on resource requirements, policies, and constraints.
    
25.  **How does Kubernetes handle high availability?**  
    By replicating critical components, like etcd and the API server, across multiple nodes.
    
26.  **What is Kubectl?**  
    `kubectl` is a command-line tool to interact with Kubernetes clusters for managing resources.
    
27.  **What is Minikube?**  
    Minikube is a tool that enables running Kubernetes clusters locally on a single node.
    
28.  **Explain RBAC in Kubernetes.**  
    Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) restricts access to Kubernetes resources based on roles and role bindings.
    
29.  **What is the purpose of a ServiceAccount?**  
    A ServiceAccount provides an identity for pods to interact with the Kubernetes API securely.
    
30.  **What is the difference between a Deployment and a StatefulSet?**  
    Deployment manages stateless applications, while StatefulSet manages stateful applications, ensuring pod identity and persistent storage.
    



31.  **How to troubleshoot a pod in Kubernetes?**  
    Use `kubectl logs`, `kubectl describe pod`, and `kubectl get events` to diagnose issues.
    
32.  **What is Pod Disruption Budget (PDB)?**  
    PDB specifies the minimum number of pods that must be up, preventing disruptions below a certain threshold.
    
33.  **How does Kubernetes handle secrets?**  
    Secrets are stored in base64 format and can be mounted as volumes or environment variables.
    
34.  **What is a Kubernetes Operator?**  
    Operators are applications that extend Kubernetes, encapsulating complex operational knowledge for managing resources.
    
35.  **How does Kubernetes handle scaling?**  
    Kubernetes scales applications horizontally using the Horizontal Pod Autoscaler and node scaling via Cluster Autoscaler.
    
36.  **What are Init Containers?**  
    Init containers run before application containers to perform setup tasks like configuration or dependency checks.
    
37.  **Explain the role of Cluster Autoscaler.**  
    The Cluster Autoscaler adds or removes nodes based on the scheduling requirements of pending pods.
    
38.  **How can you create a Kubernetes cluster?**  
    Use tools like `kubeadm`, `kops`, or cloud providers (EKS, GKE, AKS) to create a Kubernetes cluster.
    
39.  **What is the function of Kube-Proxy?**  
    Kube-Proxy handles network rules on nodes, managing traffic routing for services within the cluster.
    
40.  **How to restrict network communication in Kubernetes?**  
    Network Policies control communication between pods, allowing restrictions based on labels and namespaces.
    



41.  **How do you secure a Kubernetes cluster?**
    
     Implement RBAC, limit API access, use network policies, secure etcd, and regularly update components.

42.  **What is a Sidecar Container?**  
    A sidecar container runs alongside the main container to assist with tasks like logging, monitoring, or proxying.
    
43.  **What is a Headless Service?**  
    A Headless Service provides direct access to individual pod IPs without load balancing, enabling stateful applications.
    
44.  **What is the purpose of Kubernetes Audit Logs?**  
    Audit logs record actions taken by users or other components in the Kubernetes API server.
    
45.  **How does Kubernetes handle multi-tenancy?**  
    By using namespaces, RBAC, and network policies, Kubernetes isolates resources between tenants.
    
46.  **Explain Blue-Green Deployment in Kubernetes.**  
    In Blue-Green Deployment, two environments run simultaneously, allowing one to be live while the other is updated.
    
47.  **How does Kubernetes support canary deployments?**  
    By gradually shifting traffic to new versions using multiple services, Ingress, or tools like Istio.
    
48.  **What is an Admission Controller in Kubernetes?**  
    Admission controllers are plugins that validate and modify requests before they reach the API server.
    
49.  **How to back up etcd in Kubernetes?**  
    Use `etcdctl` commands to create backups and store them securely, essential for cluster recovery.
    
50.  **What is K8s Federation?**  
    Kubernetes Federation manages multiple clusters, enabling workloads to be distributed across clusters for high availability and disaster recovery.
