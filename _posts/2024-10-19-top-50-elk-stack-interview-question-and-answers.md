    _ELK Stack_ is a collection of three open-source tools: **Elasticsearch**, **Logstash**, and **Kibana**, used for centralized logging, data analysis, and visualization.
    
    -   **Elasticsearch**: Search and analytics engine.
    -   **Logstash**: Data collection and transformation pipeline.
    -   **Kibana**: Visualization and dashboard interface.
2.  **Why is the ELK Stack popular?**
    
    -   Centralized logging for better monitoring and troubleshooting.
    -   Scalable and real-time analytics.
    -   Open-source and cost-effective.
3.  **Explain the architecture of the ELK Stack.**
    
    -   Logstash collects and processes data.
    -   Elasticsearch stores and indexes the processed data.
    -   Kibana visualizes the data using dashboards.
4.  **What is Elasticsearch?**
    
    -   It’s a distributed search engine based on **Lucene** that supports full-text search and analytics on large datasets.
5.  **What is Logstash?**
    
    -   A data pipeline tool used to collect, process, and forward data into Elasticsearch or other outputs.
6.  **What is Kibana?**
    
    -   A visualization tool for Elasticsearch data. It allows users to create interactive dashboards and visualizations.
7.  **What are some use cases of the ELK Stack?**
    
    -   Log analysis and monitoring.
    -   Application performance monitoring (APM).
    -   Security and compliance.
    -   Business intelligence and analytics.
8.  **What is the difference between ELK and EFK?**
    
    -   EFK Stack replaces Logstash with **Fluentd**, which is lighter and more resource-efficient.
9.  **What are Beats in the ELK ecosystem?**
    
    -   Beats are lightweight data shippers that send data directly to Elasticsearch or Logstash. Examples include **Filebeat**, **Metricbeat**, and **Packetbeat**.
10.  **What is the purpose of Filebeat?**
    
     -   It collects log files and forwards them to Logstash or Elasticsearch.



11.  **What is an Elasticsearch index?**
    
     -   An index is a collection of documents in Elasticsearch. It’s similar to a database in relational systems.
12.  **What is a document in Elasticsearch?**
    
     -   A document is the basic unit of data, stored in JSON format.
13.  **Explain Elasticsearch shards.**
    
     -   Shards split an index into smaller parts to distribute and process data across multiple nodes.
14.  **What are replicas in Elasticsearch?**
    
     -   Replicas are copies of primary shards used for fault tolerance and load balancing.
15.  **How does Elasticsearch handle full-text search?**
    
     -   Elasticsearch uses the **Inverted Index** data structure and **Lucene Query** for full-text search.
16.  **What are Elasticsearch analyzers?**
    
     -   Analyzers process text data for indexing and searching. Examples: standard, whitespace, and custom analyzers.
17.  **What is a query DSL in Elasticsearch?**
    
     -   Query DSL (Domain Specific Language) is used to write queries, such as `match`, `term`, or `range`.
18.  **How does Elasticsearch differ from traditional databases?**
    
     -   It is schema-free, supports distributed architecture, and excels in full-text search.
19.  **What is a mapping in Elasticsearch?**
    
     -   Mapping defines how a document’s fields are stored and indexed.
20.  **What is the purpose of Elasticsearch aggregations?**
    
     -   Aggregations allow advanced analytics, such as data summarization and statistical calculations.


21.  **What are Logstash pipelines?**
    
     -   A pipeline is a sequence of stages: **input**, **filter**, and **output**, used to process data.
22.  **What is the purpose of the Logstash config file?**
    
     -   The config file defines input sources, filters, and output destinations.
23.  **What are Logstash plugins?**
    
     -   Plugins are modular components in Logstash:
        -   Input Plugins: Fetch data (e.g., `file`, `beats`).
        -   Filter Plugins: Process data (e.g., `grok`, `mutate`).
        -   Output Plugins: Send data (e.g., `elasticsearch`, `stdout`).
24.  **What is the grok filter in Logstash?**
    
     -   Grok filters parse unstructured data into structured data using predefined patterns.
25.  **How do you monitor Logstash performance?**
    
     -   Use monitoring APIs, log files, and pipeline metrics in Kibana.
26.  **How does Logstash handle failures?**
    
     -   It retries events and uses a **dead letter queue** for failed events.
27.  **What is a multiline filter in Logstash?**
    
     -   It combines multiple log lines into a single event, often used for stack traces.
28.  **What is the use of conditionals in Logstash pipelines?**
    
     -   Conditionals apply filters or outputs based on specific criteria.
29.  **Can Logstash output to multiple destinations?**
    
     -   Yes, it supports multiple outputs like Elasticsearch, S3, and Kafka.
30.  **How do you secure Logstash?**
    
     -   Use SSL/TLS encryption, authentication, and pipeline-specific access controls.

43.  **What is the Elastic Common Schema (ECS)?**
    
     -   A standard schema for structured logging across the ELK ecosystem.
44.  **How does Elasticsearch ensure data consistency?**
    
     -   By using **write-ahead logging (WAL)** and primary-replica synchronization.
45.  **How can you optimize Elasticsearch queries?**
    
     -   Use filters instead of queries, minimize wildcard usage, and ensure proper indexing.
46.  **What is hot-warm architecture in Elasticsearch?**
    
     -   A tiered storage approach where hot nodes handle frequent queries, and warm nodes store older data.
