### 24. **How does Twistlock secure serverless functions?**

Twistlock scans serverless functions for vulnerabilities, monitors their runtime behavior, and ensures compliance with organizational standards.

### 25. **What is Forensic Data in Twistlock?**

Forensic data includes logs and events collected during runtime, which help analyze and respond to security incidents.



### 26. **How would you configure a custom compliance policy in Twistlock?**

To configure a custom compliance policy:

1.  Navigate to the Compliance tab in the Console.
    
2.  Create a new policy or modify an existing one.
    
3.  Define specific rules and thresholds.
    
4.  Apply the policy to relevant collections.
    

### 27. **How would you integrate Twistlock with Jenkins?**
