1.  **What is Docker?**  
    Docker is a containerization platform that packages applications and dependencies into lightweight, portable containers that run consistently across various environments.
    
2.  **What is a Docker container?**  
    A container is a lightweight, portable, and self-contained package that includes everything needed to run an application, ensuring consistency across different environments.
    
3.  **How does Docker differ from virtual machines (VMs)?**  
    Unlike VMs, Docker containers share the host OS kernel, making them more lightweight and faster to start than VMs, which need a separate OS instance.
    
4.  **What is Docker Hub?**  
    Docker Hub is a public repository for Docker images, allowing users to share and access pre-built images.
    
5.  **What is a Dockerfile?**  
    A Dockerfile is a text file with instructions to build a Docker image. It defines the base image, dependencies, commands, and other configurations for the image.
    
6.  **Explain the concept of an image in Docker.**  
    A Docker image is a read-only template that contains the application and its dependencies, used to create containers.
    
7.  **How do you create a Docker image?**  
    Use the `docker build` command with a Dockerfile to create an image.
    
8.  **What is the difference between `docker run` and `docker start`?**  
    `docker run` creates and starts a new container, while `docker start` restarts an existing stopped container.
    
9.  **Explain the purpose of the `docker-compose` tool.**  
    Docker Compose is used to define and manage multi-container Docker applications with a single YAML configuration file (`docker-compose.yml`).
    
10.  **What is the purpose of a Docker namespace?**  
    Namespaces provide isolation to containers in terms of processes, network, and file systems.
    


11.  **How do you list all running Docker containers?**  
    Use `docker ps` to list running containers.
    
12.  **How do you stop a Docker container?**  
    Use `docker stop <container_id>` to stop a container.
    
13.  **How do you remove a Docker container?**  
    Use `docker rm <container_id>` to remove a container.
    
14.  **How do you remove a Docker image?**  
    Use `docker rmi <image_id>` to remove an image.
    
15.  **Explain `docker pull` and `docker push`.**  
    `docker pull` downloads an image from Docker Hub, while `docker push` uploads an image to a repository.
    
16.  **How do you check the logs of a Docker container?**  
    Use `docker logs <container_id>` to view container logs.
    
17.  **How do you execute a command inside a running container?**  
    Use `docker exec -it <container_id> <command>` to run a command inside a container.
    
18.  **What is the `docker inspect` command used for?**  
    `docker inspect` provides detailed information about a container or image, such as configuration and state.
    
19.  **How do you restart a Docker container?**  
    Use `docker restart <container_id>` to restart a container.
    
20.  **How do you tag a Docker image?**  
    Use `docker tag <source_image> <target_image>` to add a tag to an image.
    



21.  **What is Docker networking?**  
    Docker networking allows communication between containers within a host and across multiple hosts.
    
22.  **What are the different Docker network types?**  
    Bridge, host, overlay, and macvlan.
    
23.  **What is the default network in Docker?**  
    Bridge network is the default network for Docker containers.
    
24.  **How do you connect a container to a specific network?**  
    Use `docker network connect <network_name> <container_id>` to connect a container to a network.
    
25.  **What is Docker Compose networking?**  
    Docker Compose automatically creates a network for all services in the `docker-compose.yml` file, allowing containers to communicate.
    
26.  **How do you expose ports in Docker?**  
    Use the `-p` or `--publish` option in `docker run` to map container ports to the host.
    
27.  **What is the purpose of `docker network create`?**  
    `docker network create` is used to create a custom network for Docker containers.
    
28.  **How do containers in a bridge network communicate?**  
    Containers communicate through the bridge network’s IP addressing, isolating traffic from other networks.
    
29.  **Explain the overlay network in Docker Swarm.**  
    Overlay networks enable communication between Docker services across multiple hosts in a swarm.
    
30.  **What is a macvlan network?**  
    Macvlan allows containers to appear as physical devices on the network, providing unique MAC addresses for each container.


31.  **What is a Docker volume?**  
    A Docker volume is a persistent storage mechanism that allows data to be shared and retained independently of container lifecycles.
    
32.  **How do you create a Docker volume?**  
    Use `docker volume create <volume_name>` to create a volume.
    
33.  **How do you mount a volume in Docker?**  
    Use `-v <volume_name>:<container_path>` when running a container.
    
34.  **Explain bind mounts in Docker.**  
    Bind mounts map directories from the host system directly into the container, providing a way to share data between them.
    
35.  **How do you remove a Docker volume?**  
    Use `docker volume rm <volume_name>` to remove a volume.
    
36.  **What is the difference between volumes and bind mounts?**  
    Volumes are managed by Docker and stored separately, while bind mounts reference specific host directories.
    
37.  **Can you use multiple volumes in a single container?**  
    Yes, multiple volumes can be attached to a container using the `-v` option.
    
38.  **How does Docker handle data persistence?**  
    Data can persist in Docker through volumes or by using external storage solutions.
    
39.  **What is the purpose of `docker volume inspect`?**  
    It provides details about a specific volume, such as its mount point and configuration.
    
40.  **Explain the concept of tmpfs mount in Docker.**  
    A tmpfs mount is a temporary file system in memory, useful for storing non-persistent data in containers.
    



41.  **What is Docker Swarm?**  
    Docker Swarm is Docker’s native clustering and orchestration tool, used for managing containerized applications across a cluster.
    
42.  **How do you initialize a Docker Swarm?**  
    Use `docker swarm init` on the manager node to initialize a swarm.
    
43.  **What are Swarm services?**  
    Services are tasks that run containers across swarm nodes, managed by Docker Swarm.
    
44.  **What is the difference between Swarm and Kubernetes?**  
    Swarm is Docker’s native orchestration, simpler but less feature-rich, while Kubernetes is an advanced orchestration tool with complex features and broader adoption.
    
45.  **How do you add a node to a Docker Swarm?**  
    Use `docker swarm join` with the token provided by the manager node.
    
46.  **What is the purpose of `docker service` commands in Swarm?**  
    `docker service` commands create, update, and manage services in a swarm.
    
47.  **How does scaling work in Docker Swarm?**  
    Scaling increases or decreases the number of service replicas across the cluster.
    
48.  **What are Docker Swarm nodes?**  
    Nodes are machines in the swarm cluster; they can be managers or workers.
    
49.  **How does Docker handle container health checks?**  
    Docker checks the health status defined in the Dockerfile or `docker-compose.yml` to restart or manage unhealthy containers.
    
50.  **What are labels in Docker Swarm?**  
    Labels are metadata used to organize and manage resources in Swarm, like services and containers.
