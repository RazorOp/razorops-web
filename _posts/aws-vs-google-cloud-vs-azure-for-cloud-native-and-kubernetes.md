Cloud adoption is no longer about “moving to the cloud.” It’s about **building cloud-native platforms** that are scalable, observable, automated, and Kubernetes-driven.

This guide provides a **deep comparison of**

* Amazon Web Services
* Google Cloud
* Microsoft Azure

with a focus on **Kubernetes, platform engineering, DevOps, and modern workloads**, aligned with standards pioneered by the Cloud Native Computing Foundation.

## What “Cloud-Native” Means in 2026

Cloud-native architecture is built on:

* Containers (OCI images)
* Kubernetes orchestration
* Immutable infrastructure
* GitOps & CI/CD automation
* Service mesh & observability
* Autoscaling + cost optimization
* API-driven infrastructure (IaC)

All three clouds now provide **fully managed Kubernetes ecosystems**, but their philosophy differs:

| Cloud | Philosophy                                                          |
| ----- | ------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| AWS   | Infrastructure-first, extremely flexible, best for custom platforms |
| GCP   | Kubernetes-first, opinionated, developer-friendly                   |
| Azure | Enterprise-first, Microsoft ecosystem integration                   |

# Final Verdict

There is **no single winner** anymore.

* Choose **AWS** if you want **maximum control and scale engineering**
* Choose **GCP** if you want **true cloud-native velocity**
* Choose **Azure** if you want **enterprise + hybrid Kubernetes**

The best organizations today are **cloud-agnostic but Kubernetes-standardized**.

# Top 20 Interview FAQs (Cloud-Native + Kubernetes)

### 1. Why is Kubernetes central to cloud-native architecture?

It abstracts infrastructure differences, enabling portability across clouds.

### 2. Difference between EKS, GKE, and AKS?

They are managed Kubernetes services with different automation, networking, and ecosystem strengths.

### 3. Which cloud provides the most “native” Kubernetes experience?

GCP, because Kubernetes originated from Google’s internal Borg system.

### 4. What is Autopilot mode?

A fully managed model where the cloud handles node provisioning and scaling automatically.

### 5. How does AWS Karpenter differ from Cluster Autoscaler?

Karpenter provisions right-sized nodes dynamically instead of scaling predefined node groups.

### 6. Which cloud is best for multi-cluster management?

GCP’s fleet model is most mature.

### 7. How do clouds implement workload identity?

IAM roles mapped to Kubernetes service accounts (IRSA / Workload Identity / Managed Identity).

### 8. What is cloud-native observability?

Metrics, logs, and traces integrated with autoscaling and SLO-driven operations.

### 9. Why is serverless containers adoption increasing?

They eliminate node management while retaining container flexibility.

### 10. What is GitOps?

Deployment model where Git is the single source of truth for infrastructure and apps.

### 11. Which cloud is strongest for FinOps?

AWS provides deepest cost visibility; GCP provides strongest automation.

### 12. How do clouds differ in networking models?

AWS uses VPC-centric networking; GCP offers pod-native networking; Azure integrates enterprise VNets.

### 13. What is a service mesh’s role?

Handles traffic management, mTLS security, and observability between microservices.

### 14. How do managed Kubernetes services handle upgrades?

GKE automates most upgrades; EKS offers more manual control; AKS balances both.

### 15. What are cloud-native storage patterns?

Object storage + CSI volumes + distributed databases.

### 16. Why is multi-cloud becoming common?

To avoid vendor lock-in and optimize workload placement.

### 17. What skills should a platform engineer know today?

Kubernetes, Terraform, observability, networking, and cost optimization.

### 18. What replaces traditional DevOps pipelines?

GitOps + platform APIs + internal developer portals.

### 19. How does security change in cloud-native systems?

Identity becomes the perimeter (Zero-Trust model).

### 20. What is the future of Kubernetes in cloud providers?

It will become a hidden control plane—developers interact with platforms, not clusters.
