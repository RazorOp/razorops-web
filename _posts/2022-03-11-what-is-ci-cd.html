<h3>WHAT IS CI/CD ?</h3>
<img src="{{page.image}}" >

<i>Continuous Integration(CI)</i> is a software development practice where developers frequently merge the code and the changes in a central repository. The important goals of continuous integration is to find and resolve the bugs more quicker, improve the software quality, and reduce the time taken to validate and release new software updates.
<br>
<br>
<i>Continuous Delivery(CD)</i>, which is done on the top of Continuous Integration and includes the practice of automating the entire software release process and builds.
<br><br>


<h3>WHAT IS CI/CD PIPELINE ?</h3>
<br>
CI/CD pipeline is a series of steps that include all the stages from the beginning of the CI/CD process and it is responsible for creating an automated and seamless software delivery process. With a CI/CD pipeline, a software release artifact can move and progress through the pipeline right from the code check-in stage through the builds, tests, and different deployment stages.
<br>
<br>
A CI/CD pipeline consists of a series of sub-processes that can be classified into two major categories â€“ Continuous Integration and Continuous Delivery.
<br>
<br>

1.Continuous Integration: Plan, Code, Build and Test stages/scenarios
2.Continuous Delivery: Test, Release, Deploy and Operate.

<h3>Pipeline stages :</h3>
<br>
<br>
A CI/CD pipeline can be classified further into four main stages:
<br><br>
1. Source
2. Build
3. Test
4. Deployment

    }
  ]
}

</pre>
<br>
Replace DOC-EXAMPLE-BUCKET name with your bucket name
<br>

Following Setup to add Razorops CICD for AWS S3<br>
1) Create Razorops Account<br>
2) Create Pipeline<br>
3) Add AWS ENV to pipeline<br>
4) Add .razorops.yaml file to your project root and push your code as specified branch

tasks:
  build:
    steps:
    - checkout
    # commands to upload static pages folder to AWS S3
    - commands:
      - aws s3 rm s3://$AWS_S3_BUCKET --recursive
      - aws s3 cp _site s3://$AWS_S3_BUCKET --recursive
      if: branch == 'main'
