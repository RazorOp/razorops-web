**1. Error: Permission denied**

Example command:

    $ sudo rm /etc/sensitive_file

**Solution:** This error occurs when a user tries to execute a command that requires higher privileges than what they currently have. The solution is to use the sudo command before the original command to execute it with superuser privileges.

Corrected command:

    $ sudo rm /etc/sensitive_file

**2. Error: Command not found**

Example command:

    $ some_command

**Solution**: This error indicates that the system cannot find the specified command or program in the directories listed in the PATH environment variable. The solution is to either provide the full path to the command or check if the command is installed and available in the system’s PATH.

Corrected command (if the command is installed):

    $ /path/to/some_command

Or install the command if it’s missing:

$ sudo apt-get install some_package

**3. Error: File or directory not found**

Example command:

    $ cat /path/to/nonexistent_file

**Solution:** This error occurs when the specified file or directory does not exist in the given path. To resolve this issue, ensure that the file or directory exists or provide the correct path.

**Corrected command:** Ensure the file exists or provide the correct path.

**4. Error: Syntax error near unexpected token**

Example command:

    $ for i in {1..5}

**Solution:** This error typically occurs in scripts when there’s a syntax error. In this example, it could be due to a missing do keyword after the loop declaration. Check the syntax of the command or script and correct any errors accordingly.

**Corrected command:**

    $ for i in {1..5}; do echo $i; done

**5. Error: Segmentation fault (core dumped)**

Example command:

    $ ./my_program

**Solution:** A segmentation fault occurs when a program tries to access memory that it doesn’t have permission to access. This could be due to a bug in the program. To fix this, you’ll need to debug the program’s source code to identify and fix the issue causing the segmentation fault.

**Corrected solution:** Debug the program’s source code to identify and fix the issue causing the segmentation fault.

**6. Error: Unable to resolve host**

Example command:

     $ ping nonexistent_host

**Solution:** This error indicates that the DNS resolver cannot resolve the hostname to an IP address. Check the hostname spelling and verify DNS configuration in /etc/resolv.conf. Additionally, ensure that the host is reachable and DNS servers are configured correctly.

**Corrected command:** Check hostname spelling and DNS configuration.

**7. Error: Connection refused**

Example command:

    $ ssh user@remote_host

**Solution:** This error occurs when the remote server actively refuses a connection attempt. Check if the SSH service is running on the remote host and ensure that you have the correct credentials and permissions to access it.

**Corrected solution:** Ensure SSH service is running on the remote host and credentials are correct.

**8. Error: No space left on device**

Example command:

    $ touch /mnt/full_disk/file

Solution: This error indicates that the filesystem where the command is trying to write does not have enough space left. You need to free up space on the device or allocate more space to the filesystem.

Corrected solution: Free up space on the device or allocate more space to the filesystem.

**9. Error: Operation not permitted**

Example command:

    $ mount /dev/sdb1 /mnt/usb_drive

**Solution:** This error occurs when the user does not have sufficient permissions to perform the operation. Ensure that the user has the necessary permissions or use the sudo command to execute the operation with superuser privileges.

Corrected command:

    $ sudo mount /dev/sdb1 /mnt/usb_drive

**10. Error: Invalid argument**

Example command:

    $ chmod 999 /path/to/file

Solution: This error occurs when an invalid argument is provided to a command. In this example, the chmod command expects permissions in octal format (e.g., 644, 755) but 999 is not a valid permission value. Provide a valid argument according to the command’s requirements.

Corrected command: 
Provide a valid permission value to chmod command, e.g., $ chmod 755 /path/to/file.

**11. Error: No such file or directory**

Example command:

    $ cd /nonexistent_directory

**Solution:** This error indicates that the specified directory does not exist. Doublecheck the directory path and ensure it exists or provide the correct path.

Corrected command: Ensure the directory exists or provide the correct path.

**12. Error: Read-only file system**

Example command:

    $ touch /mnt/read_only_file

**Solution:** This error occurs when trying to write to a read-only filesystem. Remount the filesystem as read-write or move the operation to a writable filesystem.

Corrected solution: Remount the filesystem as read-write or perform the operation on a writable filesystem.

**13. Error: Connection timed out**

Example command:

    $ ping remote_host

**Solution:** This error occurs when the system fails to establish a connection within a certain timeframe. Check the network connectivity, firewall settings, and whether the remote host is reachable.

Corrected solution: Ensure network connectivity, firewall settings, and reachability of the remote host.

**14. Error: Disk quota exceeded**

Example command:

    $ touch /home/user/new_file

**Solution:** This error occurs when a user exceeds their allocated disk quota. Delete unnecessary files or request a quota increase from the system administrator.

Corrected solution: Delete unnecessary files or request a quota increase from the system administrator.

**15. Error: Too many open files**

Example command:

    $ cat large_number_of_files*

Corrected solution: Remove the old host key or update the known_hosts file.

**19. Error: Bad file descriptor**

Example command:

    $ cat <&10

**Solution:** This error occurs when trying to read from or write to a file descriptor that is not open. Check file descriptor usage and ensure they are properly initialized.

Corrected solution: Check file descriptor usage and ensure they are properly initialized.

**20. Error: Operation not supported**

Example command:

    $ mkfs -t ntfs /dev/sda1

**Solution:** This error occurs when trying to perform an operation that is not supported by the system or filesystem. Use a different command or filesystem type that is supported by the system.

Corrected solution: Use a different command or filesystem type supported by the system.

**21. Error: File exists**

Example command:

    $ mkdir existing_directory

**Solution:** This error occurs when trying to create a file or directory with a name that already exists in the specified location. Choose a different name or remove the existing file/directory before creating a new one.

Corrected solution: Choose a different name or remove the existing file/directory before creating a new one.

**22. Error: Too many arguments**

Example command:

    $ ls -l /path/to/directory some_other_argument
