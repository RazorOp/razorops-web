# cdk8s components
<br>
cdk8s, or Cloud Development Kit for Kubernetes, is a software development framework that allows you to define Kubernetes applications using familiar programming languages. It leverages the power of modern programming languages to streamline the process of defining, deploying, and managing Kubernetes resources.
<br>
<br>

### **The cdk8s framework consists of several key components:**
<br>

* **Constructs:** Constructs in cdk8s are building blocks for defining Kubernetes resources. They represent a piece of the infrastructure, such as a Pod, Deployment, Service, etc. These constructs can be composed to create more complex applications.
<br>
<br>

* **APIs:** The APIs in cdk8s provide a way to define Kubernetes resources using programming constructs. These APIs are available for various resource types in Kubernetes, allowing you to create and manipulate resources directly from your code.
<br>
<br>

* **cdk8s CLI:** The cdk8s command-line interface is a tool that facilitates the initialization and synthesis of cdk8s projects. It assists in setting up your development environment and generating boilerplate code.
<br>
<br>

* **cdk8s Libraries:** These are libraries that provide pre-built constructs for common Kubernetes resources. They encapsulate best practices and help you build applications more efficiently.
<br>
<br>

* **Context:** Context provides information about your development environment, such as the target Kubernetes cluster, default namespace, etc. It helps in adapting your application to different environments without code changes.
<br>
<br>

* **cdk8s Apps:** Apps are higher-level abstractions that define an entire set of resources required for an application. They make it easier to organize and deploy complex applications.
<br>
<br>

* **cdk8s+ Libraries:** These are extension libraries that build on top of cdk8s libraries to provide additional functionality, such as integration with other AWS services.
<br>
<br>

* **Construct Libraries:** These are community-contributed libraries that extend the capabilities of cdk8s by providing pre-built constructs for specific use cases or applications.
<br>
<br>

* **cdk8s+ CLI:** An extension of the cdk8s CLI, cdk8s+ CLI provides additional commands and functionality for working with cdk8s+ libraries.
<br>
<br>

These components work together to provide a powerful and flexible framework for defining Kubernetes applications using popular programming languages like TypeScript, Python, and Java. By leveraging cdk8s, developers can bring their software engineering practices to Kubernetes infrastructure, resulting in more maintainable, scalable, and efficient applications.
