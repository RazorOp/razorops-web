-   **Automated Recovery:** Using scripts and tools to automatically recover from failures.

These questions and answers provide a solid foundation for understanding the key concepts and practices in DevOps.

### 11. **What is Terraform, and how does it work?**

**Answer:**  
Terraform is an open-source Infrastructure as Code (IaC) tool developed by HashiCorp. It allows you to define and provision infrastructure using a high-level configuration language (HCL - HashiCorp Configuration Language). Terraform works by taking your infrastructure configuration files, processing them to understand the desired state of your infrastructure, and then creating or modifying resources to match that state.

### 12. **What are the key features of Terraform?**

**Answer:**

-   **Infrastructure as Code (IaC):** Define your infrastructure using code.
-   **Execution Plans:** Terraform generates an execution plan, showing what it will do when you apply the changes.
-   **Resource Graph:** Terraform builds a dependency graph to understand resource relationships and create resources in the correct order.
-   **Provider Ecosystem:** Supports multiple cloud providers and on-premises solutions.
-   **State Management:** Maintains the state of your infrastructure, enabling incremental updates and tracking changes.

### 13. **What is a Terraform provider?**

**Answer:**  
A Terraform provider is a plugin that allows Terraform to interact with APIs of cloud providers, SaaS providers, or other services. Providers allow you to define resources that Terraform will manage. For example, the AWS provider allows you to manage AWS resources like EC2 instances, S3 buckets, and VPCs.

### 14. **What is a Terraform module, and why would you use one?**

**Answer:**  
A Terraform module is a container for multiple resources that are used together. Modules are a way to organize and reuse configuration across projects and environments. By using modules, you can create standard, reusable infrastructure components (like a VPC or an EC2 instance configuration) that can be instantiated multiple times with different inputs.

### 15. **What is Terraform state, and why is it important?**

**Answer:**  
Terraform state is a file that keeps track of the current state of your infrastructure. It’s important because it helps Terraform understand the difference between your desired configuration and the actual infrastructure. The state file allows Terraform to determine what changes need to be applied when you run `terraform apply`.

### 16. **How do you handle Terraform state in a team environment?**

**Answer:**  
In a team environment, Terraform state can be stored remotely to allow multiple users to collaborate on infrastructure changes. Remote state storage options include:

-   **Terraform Cloud:** Terraform’s managed service for state storage.
-   **S3 with DynamoDB (for locking):** Commonly used in AWS environments to store state files in S3 and use DynamoDB for state locking.
-   **Azure Blob Storage, Google Cloud Storage, etc.:** For respective cloud environments.

### 17. **What are Terraform workspaces, and when would you use them?**

**Answer:**  
Terraform workspaces allow you to manage different states for the same configuration, which is useful for managing different environments like development, staging, and production. Each workspace has its own state file, so changes in one workspace do not affect others.

### 18. **How does Terraform handle dependencies between resources?**

**Answer:**  
Terraform automatically creates a dependency graph based on resource references in your configuration. For example, if an EC2 instance depends on a security group, Terraform will understand this dependency and create the security group before the EC2 instance. You can also use explicit dependencies with the `depends_on` argument if necessary.

### 19. **What is the `terraform plan` command, and how is it used?**

**Answer:**  
The `terraform plan` command is used to create an execution plan, showing what actions Terraform will take to reach the desired state. This command allows you to review the changes that will be made before applying them, ensuring that you understand the impact of the changes.

### 20. **What is a `terraform apply` command?**

**Answer:**  
The `terraform apply` command is used to apply the changes defined in your Terraform configuration files. It executes the actions shown in the plan, updating the infrastructure to match the desired state. After execution, the state file is updated to reflect the current state of the infrastructure.

### 21. **How do you manage secrets in Terraform?**

**Answer:**  
Secrets in Terraform should be managed using secure methods, such as:

-   **Environment Variables:** Storing secrets in environment variables and referencing them in your configuration.
-   **Terraform Variables:** Storing sensitive data in variables with `sensitive = true`.
-   **Integration with Secret Managers:** Using AWS Secrets Manager, HashiCorp Vault, or other secret management tools to securely retrieve secrets.

### 22. **What is the difference between `terraform import` and `terraform state` commands?**

**Answer:**

-   **`terraform import`:** Used to import existing infrastructure into Terraform's state, so it can be managed by Terraform. It requires you to manually add the corresponding resource block in your configuration.
-   **`terraform state`:** Commands used to manage Terraform's state file directly, including moving resources between modules or removing resources from the state.

### 23. **How do you handle drift detection in Terraform?**

**Answer:**  
Drift detection in Terraform involves identifying differences between the actual state of resources and the desired state defined in your configuration. Running `terraform plan` regularly allows you to detect and correct drift by showing any differences that need to be reconciled.

### 24. **What is the `terraform taint` command?**

**Answer:**  
The `terraform taint` command marks a resource for recreation during the next apply. This is useful when you want to force the recreation of a resource without changing the configuration.

### 25. **How does Terraform differ from other IaC tools like CloudFormation or Ansible?**

**Answer:**

-   **Terraform vs. CloudFormation:** Terraform is cloud-agnostic, meaning it can manage infrastructure across multiple cloud providers, whereas CloudFormation is specific to AWS.
-   **Terraform vs. Ansible:** Terraform is declarative and primarily focused on provisioning infrastructure, whereas Ansible is both declarative and procedural, focusing on configuration management and orchestration.

### 26. **What is DevOps automation, and why is it important?**

**Answer:**  
DevOps automation involves the use of tools and scripts to automate the manual processes in the software development lifecycle, including code integration, testing, deployment, and infrastructure provisioning. It’s important because it increases the speed, reliability, and consistency of software delivery, reduces the risk of human error, and frees up teams to focus on more strategic tasks.

### 27. **What tools are commonly used for DevOps automation?**

**Answer:**

-   **CI/CD Tools:** Jenkins, GitLab CI, CircleCI, RazorOps
-   **Configuration Management:** Ansible, Puppet, Chef
-   **Infrastructure as Code (IaC):** Terraform, AWS CloudFormation, Azure ARM Templates
-   **Containerization:** Docker, Kubernetes
-   **Monitoring and Logging:** Prometheus, Grafana, ELK Stack
-   **Version Control:** Git, Bitbucket, GitHub
-   **Automation Scripting:** Bash, Python, PowerShell

### 28. **What is the role of CI/CD in DevOps automation?**

**Answer:**  
Continuous Integration (CI) and Continuous Deployment/Delivery (CD) are central to DevOps automation. CI involves automatically integrating code changes into a shared repository, running automated tests, and ensuring that the code is always in a deployable state. CD automates the deployment process, ensuring that changes are delivered to production quickly and reliably. Together, CI/CD pipelines automate the entire process from code commit to production deployment.

### 29. **How do you automate infrastructure provisioning in a DevOps environment?**

**Answer:**  
Infrastructure provisioning can be automated using Infrastructure as Code (IaC) tools like Terraform, AWS CloudFormation, and Azure ARM Templates. These tools allow you to define your infrastructure in code, which can be versioned, tested, and automatically applied across environments. Automation scripts and pipelines can trigger the provisioning process, ensuring consistency and repeatability.

### 30. **What is the importance of Infrastructure as Code (IaC) in automation?**

**Answer:**  
IaC is crucial for automation because it allows you to manage and provision infrastructure through code, just like application code. This approach ensures that infrastructure configurations are version-controlled, testable, and repeatable. It eliminates the need for manual configurations, reduces the risk of errors, and enables the automation of infrastructure changes through CI/CD pipelines.

### 31. **How can you automate the deployment of a microservices-based application?**

**Answer:**  
Deploying a microservices-based application can be automated using container orchestration tools like Kubernetes. You can:

-   Use Docker to containerize each microservice.
-   Define Kubernetes manifests (YAML files) to describe the desired state of the application.
-   Use a CI/CD pipeline to automatically build, test, and deploy the containers to a Kubernetes cluster.
-   Implement Helm charts for managing complex Kubernetes applications.
-   Automate scaling, updates, and rollbacks using Kubernetes' built-in capabilities.

### 32. **What are some best practices for DevOps automation?**

**Answer:**

-   **Start Small:** Begin with automating the most repetitive tasks, then expand.
-   **Use Version Control:** Store all scripts, configuration files, and infrastructure definitions in a version control system like Git.
-   **Continuous Testing:** Integrate automated testing into the CI/CD pipeline to catch errors early.
-   **Monitoring and Logging:** Implement comprehensive monitoring and logging to quickly identify and resolve issues.
-   **Idempotency:** Ensure that scripts and automation processes are idempotent, meaning they can be run multiple times without causing unintended side effects.
-   **Security Automation:** Integrate security checks and compliance testing into the automation pipeline (DevSecOps).

### 33. **How do you automate security checks in a DevOps pipeline?**

**Answer:**  
Security checks can be automated in a DevOps pipeline using DevSecOps practices. This involves:

-   **Static Application Security Testing (SAST):** Running tools like SonarQube or Checkmarx to analyze source code for vulnerabilities.
-   **Dynamic Application Security Testing (DAST):** Using tools like OWASP ZAP to test running applications for security issues.
-   **Dependency Scanning:** Automating the scanning of libraries and dependencies for known vulnerabilities using tools like Snyk or Dependabot.
-   **Infrastructure Security:** Using IaC tools to enforce security best practices, such as secure configurations and access controls.

### 34. **How do you approach automating the rollback process in a deployment pipeline?**

**Answer:**  
Automating rollbacks in a deployment pipeline involves:

-   **Versioning Deployments:** Ensuring that each deployment is versioned so that you can easily roll back to a previous version.
-   **Canary Deployments:** Gradually rolling out changes to a small subset of users and monitoring for issues before full deployment. If problems are detected, the pipeline can automatically rollback to the previous stable version.
-   **Blue-Green Deployments:** Running two identical production environments (Blue and Green) and switching traffic between them. If an issue is detected, you can instantly switch back to the previous environment.
-   **Automated Monitoring and Alerts:** Setting up automated monitoring to detect failures or performance degradation and triggering an automatic rollback.

### 35. **What is the role of scripting in DevOps automation?**

**Answer:**  
Scripting plays a vital role in DevOps automation by enabling the automation of repetitive tasks, custom workflows, and integration between different tools. Common scripting languages include Bash, Python, and PowerShell. Scripts can be used for tasks such as provisioning infrastructure, deploying applications, running tests, and performing maintenance tasks.

### 36. **What is the difference between a CI/CD pipeline and a DevOps pipeline?**

**Answer:**

-   **CI/CD Pipeline:** Specifically focuses on automating the process of integrating code changes (CI) and delivering them to production (CD). It usually involves stages like code build, testing, and deployment.
-   **DevOps Pipeline:** Encompasses the entire software delivery lifecycle, including CI/CD, infrastructure provisioning, monitoring, and feedback loops. It covers everything from code commit to production deployment and ongoing maintenance.

### 37. **How do you automate monitoring and alerting in a DevOps environment?**

**Answer:**  
Monitoring and alerting can be automated using tools like Prometheus, Grafana, and the ELK Stack. Steps include:

-   **Instrumenting Code:** Adding metrics collection in your codebase.
-   **Automated Setup:** Using IaC tools to deploy and configure monitoring tools.
-   **Alerting:** Setting up automated alerts for specific thresholds or anomalies in metrics.
-   **Integration:** Integrating monitoring with incident management tools like PagerDuty or Slack to automate notification and escalation.

### 38. **How do you ensure that your automation scripts are maintainable and reusable?**

**Answer:**  
To ensure maintainability and reusability of automation scripts:

-   **Modularize:** Break down scripts into smaller, reusable modules or functions.
-   **Document:** Provide clear documentation and comments within the scripts.
-   **Use Version Control:** Store scripts in a version control system to track changes and collaborate.
-   **Parameterize:** Use parameters and environment variables to make scripts adaptable to different environments and use cases.
-   **Test Regularly:** Implement automated tests for your scripts to catch errors and ensure reliability.

### 39. **What is Gitflow, and why is it used?**

**Answer:**  
Gitflow is a branching model for Git, proposed by Vincent Driessen, that provides a robust framework for managing feature development, releases, and hotfixes in a project. It is used because it offers a clear structure for collaboration in large projects, ensuring that features, bug fixes, and releases are handled in a consistent manner.

### 40. **What are the key branches in Gitflow, and what are their purposes?**

**Answer:**

-   **`master` Branch:** This is the main branch where the source code of HEAD always reflects a production-ready state.
-   **`develop` Branch:** This is the main branch for ongoing development. All new features are merged into `develop` and, once stable, into `master`.
-   **`feature` Branches:** Used to develop new features for upcoming releases. Feature branches are created from `develop` and merged back into `develop` once completed.
-   **`release` Branches:** Support preparation for a new production release. Once a release branch is finished, it is merged into both `master` and `develop`.
-   **`hotfix` Branches:** Created from `master` to quickly patch production issues. Once a hotfix is complete, it is merged into both `master` and `develop`.

### 41. **How do you create a new feature branch in Gitflow?**

**Answer:**  
To create a new feature branch in Gitflow:

1.  Start from the `develop` branch.
2.  Create a new branch with the naming convention `feature/feature-name`.

bash

    git checkout develop
    git checkout -b feature/feature-name

3.  Once the feature is completed, merge it back into `develop`:

bash



    git checkout develop
    git merge --no-ff feature/feature-name
    git branch -d feature/feature-name

### 42. **What is the purpose of the `release` branch in Gitflow?**

**Answer:**  
The `release` branch is used to prepare the code for production release. It is branched from `develop` and allows for final bug fixes, testing, and preparation of the release version. When the release is ready, it is merged into both `master` (for production) and `develop` (to ensure any fixes or updates made during the release process are not lost).

### 43. **How do you handle hotfixes in Gitflow?**

**Answer:**  
Hotfixes are critical changes that need to be applied to the production environment immediately. In Gitflow:

1.  A `hotfix` branch is created from `master`:

    git checkout master
    git checkout -b hotfix/hotfix-name

2.  Apply the necessary fixes on this branch.
3.  Once the hotfix is tested, it is merged back into both `master` and `develop`:

bash



    git checkout master
    git merge --no-ff hotfix/hotfix-name
    git checkout develop
    git merge --no-ff hotfix/hotfix-name
    git branch -d hotfix/hotfix-name

This ensures the hotfix is available in both production and ongoing development.

### 44. **What is the advantage of using the `--no-ff` flag during merges in Gitflow?**

**Answer:**  
The `--no-ff` flag ensures that a merge commit is always created, even if the merge could be resolved with a fast-forward. This is important in Gitflow as it preserves the history of feature branches, making it clear when and why changes were made. It helps maintain a more informative project history by showing when a feature branch was integrated.

### 45. **What are the potential challenges of using Gitflow in a CI/CD environment?**

**Answer:**

-   **Branch Management Overhead:** Gitflow involves multiple long-lived branches, which can be complex to manage in fast-paced environments with frequent deployments.
-   **Delayed Integration:** Features are developed on separate branches and only merged back into `develop` after completion, which can delay the integration of changes and increase the risk of merge conflicts.
-   **Deployment Complexity:** Managing deployments from multiple branches (e.g., `master` for production, `develop` for staging) can add complexity to the CI/CD pipeline.
-   **Long Release Cycles:** Gitflow is more suited for projects with scheduled releases rather than continuous deployment, which might not align with the rapid release cycles in some CI/CD environments.

### 46. **How does Gitflow handle versioning of releases?**

**Answer:**  
In Gitflow, versioning typically occurs on the `release` branch. When you create a release branch from `develop`, you usually assign a version number to that release:


    git checkout develop
    git checkout -b release/1.0.0

This version number is then finalized before merging into `master`. Tags are often used on the `master` branch to mark the specific commit that corresponds to a production release:

    git checkout master
    git merge --no-ff release/1.0.0
    git tag -a 1.0.0 -m "Release 1.0.0"

### 47. **How does Gitflow compare to other Git branching strategies, like GitHub Flow or GitLab Flow?**

**Answer:**

-   **Gitflow:** Suited for projects with well-defined release cycles. It uses multiple long-lived branches (`master`, `develop`, `release`, `feature`, `hotfix`) and is ideal for complex projects.
-   **GitHub Flow:** A simpler, more streamlined approach. It uses a single `master` branch with short-lived feature branches. It’s ideal for projects with continuous deployment where each feature is merged directly into `master` and deployed.
-   **GitLab Flow:** A flexible approach that can combine aspects of both Gitflow and GitHub Flow. It allows for different workflows depending on the environment (e.g., production, staging) and can support both scheduled releases and continuous deployment.

### 48. **How do you integrate Gitflow with CI/CD pipelines?**

**Answer:** To integrate Gitflow with CI/CD pipelines:

-   **Feature Branches:** Automate tests on feature branches and ensure they pass before merging into `develop`.
-   **Develop Branch:** Configure the CI pipeline to build, test, and deploy the `develop` branch to a staging or test environment.
-   **Release Branches:** Use the CI pipeline to perform final integration tests, build release artifacts, and prepare for deployment.
-   **Master Branch:** Set up the pipeline to deploy the `master` branch to production after successful testing. Tag the release in `master` for version control.
-   **Hotfixes:** Automate the deployment of hotfix branches similarly to the `master` branch, ensuring they are applied immediately and merged into both `master` and `develop`.

### 49. **What is the difference between Continuous Delivery and Continuous Deployment?**

**Answer:**

-   **Continuous Delivery:** A software development practice where code changes are automatically built, tested, and prepared for release to production. However, the deployment to production requires a manual approval step.
-   **Continuous Deployment:** Extends Continuous Delivery by automatically deploying every change that passes all stages of the production pipeline, without requiring manual approval.

### 50. **What are the key benefits of Continuous Delivery over traditional release processes?**

**Answer:**

-   **Faster Release Cycles:** Changes are always in a deployable state, allowing for more frequent releases.
-   **Reduced Risk:** Smaller, incremental changes reduce the risk of large, error-prone releases.
-   **Improved Quality:** Continuous integration and testing ensure that issues are caught early in the development process.
-   **Flexibility:** Teams can choose when to deploy changes to production, allowing for strategic release planning.

### 51. **In what scenarios might a team choose Continuous Delivery over Continuous Deployment?**

**Answer:**

-   **Regulated Industries:** Where manual approval is required for compliance or audit purposes.
-   **High-Risk Applications:** In cases where the application is mission-critical and requires thorough review before deployment.
-   **Large Organizations:** Where coordination between different teams or departments is necessary before changes go live.
-   **Legacy Systems:** When dealing with complex legacy systems that require careful, manual oversight before deployment.

### 52. **How does testing differ between Continuous Delivery and Continuous Deployment?**

**Answer:**

-   **Continuous Delivery:** Emphasizes automated testing to ensure that code is always ready for deployment. However, additional manual testing or approvals may occur before the final deployment.
-   **Continuous Deployment:** Requires an even more rigorous and comprehensive automated testing strategy because there is no manual intervention before changes are deployed. Every test must be automated, reliable, and thorough to catch issues before they reach production.

### 53. **What challenges are commonly faced when transitioning from Continuous Delivery to Continuous Deployment?**

**Answer:**

-   **Test Coverage:** Ensuring that all possible scenarios are covered by automated tests, including edge cases.
-   **Cultural Shift:** Teams must adapt to the idea of fully automated releases, which may require changes in mindset and workflows.
-   **Monitoring and Rollback:** Implementing robust monitoring, alerting, and rollback mechanisms to handle any issues that arise in production.
-   **Deployment Complexity:** Managing the complexity of automated deployments across multiple environments, including handling environment-specific configurations and dependencies.

### 54. **What role does manual approval play in Continuous Delivery, and why is it removed in Continuous Deployment?**

**Answer:**

-   **Continuous Delivery:** Manual approval acts as a final checkpoint to ensure that changes align with business goals, compliance, or other strategic considerations before going live.
-   **Continuous Deployment:** This step is removed to achieve a fully automated pipeline where every successful change is deployed to production immediately, allowing for faster delivery and feedback. The confidence in the automated tests and the deployment process replaces the need for manual intervention.

### 55. **How does the concept of a "feature toggle" fit into Continuous Delivery and Continuous Deployment?**

**Answer:**

-   **Continuous Delivery:** Feature toggles allow new features to be integrated into the codebase and tested in production environments without being visible to users until they are ready to be released. This helps in managing manual approvals.
-   **Continuous Deployment:** Feature toggles are critical, as they allow teams to deploy incomplete features to production without exposing them to users. This enables continuous deployment of code while controlling the release of new features to end-users.

### 56. **What is CI/CD, and what are its main components?**

**Answer:**

-   **CI (Continuous Integration):** A practice where code changes are automatically tested and integrated into a shared repository multiple times a day. The main components are version control systems (e.g., Git), automated build tools, and automated testing frameworks.
-   **CD (Continuous Delivery/Continuous Deployment):**
    -   **Continuous Delivery:** Automates the process of deploying code changes to a staging environment and ensures that the code is always in a deployable state, but the actual deployment to production is manual.
    -   **Continuous Deployment:** Extends Continuous Delivery by automatically deploying every change that passes all stages of the pipeline to production, with no manual intervention.

### 57. **How do you design a CI/CD pipeline? What are the key stages?**

**Answer:**  
A CI/CD pipeline typically includes the following stages:

-   **Source:** Code is committed to a version control system (e.g., Git).
-   **Build:** The code is compiled and built. This stage includes dependency management and artifact creation.
-   **Test:** Automated tests are run, including unit tests, integration tests, and sometimes end-to-end tests.
-   **Deploy:** Code is deployed to staging or production environments. In Continuous Delivery, this step is manual; in Continuous Deployment, it is automated.
-   **Monitor:** After deployment, the application is monitored for performance and errors.
-   **Feedback:** Collect feedback from monitoring and user reports to inform future changes.

### 58. **What are some common challenges you might face with CI/CD pipelines, and how do you address them?**

**Answer:**

-   **Integration Issues:** Conflicts can occur when merging code changes. To address this, maintain a frequent merge strategy and use feature flags to manage incomplete features.
-   **Test Failures:** Automated tests might fail due to flaky tests or environment issues. Ensure tests are reliable and run in a consistent environment.
-   **Deployment Failures:** Issues during deployment can occur. Implement rollback mechanisms and thorough monitoring to detect and address deployment issues quickly.
-   **Environment Configuration:** Differences between development, staging, and production environments can cause issues. Use environment configuration management tools and containerization (e.g., Docker) to maintain consistency.

### 59. **How do you ensure that your CI/CD pipeline is secure?**

**Answer:**

-   **Access Controls:** Restrict access to the CI/CD system and its configurations to authorized personnel only.
-   **Secrets Management:** Use secure methods to manage and inject secrets, such as environment variables or secret management tools (e.g., HashiCorp Vault).
-   **Code Reviews:** Implement code review processes to ensure that changes do not introduce security vulnerabilities.
-   **Dependency Scanning:** Use tools to automatically scan for vulnerabilities in dependencies and libraries.
-   **Pipeline Hardening:** Regularly update and patch CI/CD tools and dependencies to protect against known vulnerabilities.

### 60. **How do you handle rollbacks and hotfixes in a CI/CD pipeline?**

**Answer:**

-   **Rollbacks:** Implement a rollback strategy by maintaining previous stable versions of your application. Automated rollbacks can be triggered by failed deployments or critical issues detected in production. Versioning and tagging releases help in identifying and reverting to a previous state.
-   **Hotfixes:** Create hotfix branches from the `master` or `production` branch to address urgent issues. Apply the hotfix, test it thoroughly, and merge it back into both the `master` and `develop` branches. Ensure that the pipeline is capable of deploying hotfixes quickly and reliably.

### 61. **What is the primary difference between Continuous Integration (CI) and Continuous Delivery (CD)?**

**Answer:**

-   **Continuous Integration (CI):** Focuses on the practice of automatically integrating code changes from multiple contributors into a shared repository frequently (e.g., multiple times a day). It involves automated building and testing of code to detect integration issues early.
-   **Continuous Delivery (CD):** Builds on CI by automating the deployment process so that code changes are automatically prepared for release to a staging or production environment. CD ensures that the code is always in a deployable state, but the final deployment to production may still require manual approval.

### 62. **How do CI and CD contribute to improving software quality and delivery speed?**

**Answer:**

-   **CI:** Improves software quality by continuously testing code changes in a shared environment, which helps identify and fix integration issues early. It ensures that new code integrates smoothly with existing code and maintains code quality.
-   **CD:** Enhances delivery speed by automating the release process. With CD, code changes are prepared and tested for production automatically, allowing for faster and more reliable deployments. This minimizes the time between code completion and user access.

### 63. **What are the typical stages in a CI pipeline versus a CD pipeline?**

**Answer:**

-   **CI Pipeline Stages:**
    1.  **Source Code:** Code is committed to the version control system.
    2.  **Build:** The code is compiled and built into artifacts.
    3.  **Test:** Automated tests are run to validate the build.
    4.  **Feedback:** Results from the tests are communicated to developers.
-   **CD Pipeline Stages:**
    1.  **CI Stages:** Incorporates CI stages (source code, build, test).
    2.  **Deploy to Staging:** The build is deployed to a staging environment for further testing.
    3.  **Approval (if applicable):** Manual or automated approval for production deployment.
