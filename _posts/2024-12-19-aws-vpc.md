**What is AWS VPC?** 

Amazon Virtual Private Cloud (VPC) is a service that allows users to create a virtual dedicated network for resources.

**Security Groups:**

**Default Security Groups:-**

   Inbound rule - Allows all inbound traffic
   
   Outbound rule - Allows all outbound traffic
   
**Custom Security Groups:- (by default)**

   Inbound rule - Allows no inbound traffic
   
   Outbound rule - Allows all outbound traffic

**Network ACLs (access control list):**

**Default Network ACL:-**

   Inbound rule - Allows all inbound traffic
   
   Outbound rule - Allows all outbound traffic
   
**Custom Network ACL:- (by default)**

   Inbound rule - Denies all inbound traffic
   
   Outbound rule - Denies all outbound traffic

**Components of VPC:**

**Subnets**

● The subnet is a core component of the VPC.

● Resources will reside inside the Subnet only.

● Subnets are the logical division of the IP Address.

● One Subnet should not overlap another subnet.

● A subnet can be private or public.

● Resources in Public Subnet will have internet access.

● Resources in the Private Subnet will not have internet access.

● If private subnet resources want internet accessibility then we will need a NAT gateway or NAT instance in a public subnet.

**Route Tables**

● Route tables will decide where the network traffic will be directed.

● One Subnet can connect to one route table at a time.

● But one Route table can connect to multiple subnets.

● If the route table is connected to the Internet Gateway and that route table is associated with the subnet, then that subnet will be considered as a Public Subnet.

● The private subnet is not associated with the route table which is connected to the Internet gateway.

**NAT Devices**

● NAT stands for Network Address Translation.

● It allows resources in the Private subnet to connect to the internet if required.

**NAT Instance**

● It is an EC2 Instance.

● It will be deployed in the Public Subnet.

● NAT Instance allows you to initiate IPv4 Outbound traffic to the internet.

● It will not allow the instance to receive inbound traffic from the internet.

**NAT Gateway**

● Nat Gateway is Managed by AWS.

● NAT will be using the elastic IP address.

● You will be charged for NAT gateway on a per hour basis and data processing rates.

● NAT is not for IPv6 traffic.

● NAT gateway allows you to initiate IPv4 Outbound traffic to the internet.

● It will not allow the instance to receive inbound traffic from the internet.

**DHCP Options Set:**

● DHCP stands for Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol.

● It is the standard for passing the various configuration information to hosts over the TCP/IP Network.

● DHCP contains information such as domain name, domain name server.

● All this information will be contained in Configuration parameters.

● DHCP will be created automatically while creating VPC.

**PrivateLink**

● PrivateLink is a technology that will allow you to access services privately without internet connectivity and it will use the private IP Addresses.

**Endpoints**

● It allows you to create connections between your VPC and supported AWS services.

● The endpoints are powered by PrivateLink.

● The traffic will not leave the AWS network.

● It means endpoints will not require Internet Gateway, Virtual Private Gateway, NAT components.

● The public IP address is not required for communication.

● Communication will be established between the VPC and other services with high availability.

**Types of Endpoints**

**● Interface Endpoints**

o It is an entry point for traffic interception.

o It will route the traffic to the service that you configure.

o It will use an ENI with a private IP address.

o For Example: it will allow instances to connect to Amazon

Kinesis through interface endpoint.

**● Gateway Load balancer Endpoints**

o It is an entry point for traffic interception.

o It will route the traffic to the service that you configure.

o It will use load balancers to route the traffic.

o For Example Security Inspection.

**● Gateway Endpoints**

o It is a gateway that you defined in Route Table as a Target.

o And the destination will be the supported AWS Services.

o Amazon S3, DynamoDB supports Gateway Endpoint.

**Egress Only Internet Gateway**

● An egress-only internet gateway is designed only for IPv6 address communications.

● It is a highly available, horizontally scaled component which will allow outbound only rule for IPv6 traffic.

● It will not allow inbound connection to your EC2 Instances.

**VPC Peering**:

● VPC peering establishes a connection between two VPCs.

● EC2 Instances in both the VPC can communicate with each other as if they are in the same network.

● Peering connections can be established between VPCs in the same region, VPCs in a different region or VPCs in another AWS Account as well.

**VPN**

● Virtual Private Network (VPN) establish secure connections between multiple networks i.e., on-premise network, client space, AWS Cloud, and all the network acts

● VPN provides a high-available, elastic, and managed solution to protect your network traffic.

**AWS Site-to-Site VPN**

o AWS Site-to-Site VPN creates encrypted tunnels between your network and your Amazon Virtual Private Clouds or AWS Transit Gateways.

**AWS Client VPN**

o AWS Client VPN connects your users to AWS or on-premises resources using a VPN software client.

**Use Cases:**

● Host a simple public-facing website.

● Host multi-tier web applications.

● Used for disaster recovery as well.

**Pricing:**

● No additional charges for creating a custom VPC.

● NAT does not come under the free tier limit you will get charged per hour basis.

● NAT Gateway data processing charge and data transfer charges will be separate.

● You will get charged per hour basis for traffic mirroring.
