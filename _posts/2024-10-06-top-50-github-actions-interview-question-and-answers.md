1.  **What is GitHub Actions?**
    
    -   GitHub Actions is a CI/CD platform that enables automation directly within GitHub repositories for building, testing, and deploying code.
2.  **How do workflows work in GitHub Actions?**
    
    -   Workflows are automated processes defined in YAML files under `.github/workflows` and are triggered by specific events, such as `push` or `pull_request`.
3.  **What are jobs in GitHub Actions?**
    
    -   Jobs are individual tasks that run within workflows. Each job can include multiple steps and can run in parallel or sequentially.
4.  **Explain steps in GitHub Actions.**
    
    -   Steps are the individual tasks executed in a job. They can be custom shell commands or actions.
5.  **What are runners in GitHub Actions?**
    
    -   Runners are servers that execute workflows. GitHub provides hosted runners, or you can use self-hosted runners for custom environments.
6.  **What’s the difference between GitHub-hosted and self-hosted runners?**
    
    -   GitHub-hosted runners are managed by GitHub and provide common tools. Self-hosted runners are managed by users for custom configurations.
7.  **How do you define a workflow trigger in GitHub Actions?**
    
    -   Workflow triggers are defined using the `on` keyword, specifying events like `push`, `pull_request`, or `schedule`.
8.  **What are reusable workflows in GitHub Actions?**
    
    -   Reusable workflows allow common tasks to be centralized in one workflow file and invoked in multiple repositories.
9.  **What are artifacts in GitHub Actions?**
    
    -   Artifacts are files generated by workflows (e.g., build files) that can be saved and shared across jobs or with users.

10.  **How do you manage secrets in GitHub Actions?**
    
  
     - Secrets are stored in GitHub repository settings and accessed in workflows using `${{ secrets.SECRET_NAME }}` syntax.



11.  **How can you run a job only on specific branches?**
    
     - Specify branches under the `on` condition, e.g., `on: push: branches: [main, dev]`.
   
12.  **What is a matrix strategy in GitHub Actions?**
    
     - Matrix strategy runs a job multiple times with different configurations (e.g., OS, Node.js versions).
   
13.  **Explain how caching works in GitHub Actions.**
    
     - GitHub Actions supports caching dependencies to speed up workflow execution using the `actions/cache` action.
   
14.  **What is `needs` in GitHub Actions?**
    
     - `needs` is used to define job dependencies, ensuring jobs run sequentially when necessary.
    
15.  **How do you add conditional logic to GitHub Actions workflows?**
    
     - Use `if` statements to define conditions, such as `if: success()` or `if: always()`.

16.  **What is the purpose of `continue-on-error`?**
    
     - `continue-on-error: true` allows a job to proceed even if a step fails.
  
17.  **What is a composite action?**
    
     - A composite action bundles multiple steps in one action, making it reusable.
  
18.  **How do you pass environment variables across jobs?**
    
      - Use `env` for global or job-level variables or pass them as outputs between jobs.
   
19.  **How do you debug workflows in GitHub Actions?**
    
     - Use `::debug::` commands, review logs, or set up `ACTIONS_RUNNER_DEBUG` in secrets for verbose logging.
   
20.  **How do you run scheduled workflows?**
    
     - Use `on: schedule` with a cron syntax (e.g., `cron: '0 0 * * 1'` for weekly triggers).



21.  **How do you reuse workflows across repositories?**
    
     - Use reusable workflows by referencing them in other repositories with the `uses` syntax.
   
22.  **How do you handle secrets in workflows safely?**
    
     - GitHub Actions masks secrets automatically and restricts them from appearing in logs.
   
23.  **What is the purpose of `job.container`?**
    
     - `job.container` allows running jobs inside a Docker container for isolated environments.
  
24.  **What is `jobs.<job_id>.outputs`?**
    
     - Outputs are values that can be set in a job and accessed by dependent jobs.
 
25.  **Explain the purpose of the `env` keyword.**
    
     - `env` defines environment variables for steps, jobs, or workflows.
   
26.  **How can you use a Docker image in GitHub Actions?**
    
     - Define `container: image: <docker-image>` in the job or use Docker commands in steps.
  
27.  **How do you specify a particular runner version?**
    
     - Choose an OS version (e.g., `runs-on: ubuntu-latest` or `runs-on: windows-2019`).
  
28.  **What’s the purpose of `jobs.<job_id>.timeout-minutes`?**
    
     - This sets a timeout for the job, after which it’s automatically canceled.
   
29.  **What is a service container?**
    
     - Service containers are additional containers run alongside jobs, useful for databases or message queues.
   
30.  **What’s the difference between`actions/checkout@v2` and `actions/checkout@v3`?**
    
     - Each major version may introduce performance improvements and bug fixes; v3 includes enhancements over v2.



31.  **What are custom actions?**
    
     - Custom actions are user-defined tasks created in JavaScript or Docker that can be reused across workflows.
  
32.  **How do you use GitHub Actions with multiple repositories?**
    
     - Use `checkout` with repository names or trigger workflows across repos using `repository_dispatch`.
  
33.  **What is concurrency in GitHub Actions?**
    
     - Concurrency controls simultaneous runs of workflows, allowing them to cancel previous runs if needed.
  
34.  **How can you prevent secrets from leaking?**
    
     - Mask secrets in logs, avoid `set-output` with secrets, and use `secrets` safely in workflows.
  
35.  **How do you handle GitHub Actions permissions?**
    
     - Set granular permissions for actions in the repository settings or `permissions` keyword in workflows.
  
36.  **What is the purpose of `GITHUB_TOKEN`?**
    
     - `GITHUB_TOKEN` is an auto-generated token providing access to the repo for secure API interactions.
  
37.  **What is `jobs.<job_id>.strategy.fail-fast`?**
    
     - It stops all jobs in a matrix if any job fails, reducing resource use.
 
38.  **How do you manage workflow concurrency?**
    
     - Use `concurrency` to limit simultaneous runs or cancel redundant runs with `cancel-in-progress`.
  
39.  **What are required status checks in GitHub Actions?**
    
      - These are checks that must pass before merging, typically set in branch protection rules.
   
40.  **Explain the purpose of `jobs.<job_id>.defaults`.**
    
     - `defaults` provides default `run` settings for steps in a job.



41.  **How do you handle errors in GitHub Actions?**
    
     - Use `if: failure()` for error handling, or add `continue-on-error` for steps that shouldn’t block progress.
   
42.  **What are the best practices for securing workflows?**
    
     - Avoid exposing secrets, validate inputs, and use reusable actions from trusted sources.
  
43.  **How can you optimize GitHub Actions for performance?**
    
     - Use caching, parallel jobs, matrix builds, and reusable workflows.
  
44.  **How do you troubleshoot failed workflows?**
    
     - Check logs, enable debug logging, and use the `::debug::` command.
   
45.  **What’s the purpose of `jobs.<job_id>.env`?**
    
     - `env` at the job level sets environment variables available to all steps in that job.
   
46.  **How do you create a GitHub Action using JavaScript?**
    
     - Create an action.yml file, define inputs, and use JavaScript to build the action logic.
   
47.  **What’s the role of `jobs.<job_id>.if`?**
    
      - `if` allows conditional job execution based on specific criteria.
   
48.  **What is `on.workflow_call`?**
    
     - `on.workflow_call` triggers a reusable workflow, allowing it to be called from other workflows.
   
49.  **How can you share artifacts across jobs?**
    
     - Use `upload-artifact` to save files in one job and `download-artifact` to access them in another.
  
50.  **What are the benefits of GitHub Actions over other CI/CD tools?**
    
     - GitHub Actions provides native GitHub integration, reusable workflows, strong community support, and flexible automation.
