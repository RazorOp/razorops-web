### 7. **What is a Terraform state file?**

-   **Answer**: The Terraform state file (often `terraform.tfstate`) is a JSON file that stores information about the infrastructure resources managed by Terraform. It allows Terraform to track resource configurations and detect changes.

### 8. **Explain the concept of idempotency in IaC.**

-   **Answer**: Idempotency in IaC means that applying the same configuration multiple times results in the same infrastructure state, ensuring consistency and preventing unintended changes.

### 9. **What are Modules in Terraform?**

-   **Answer**: Modules in Terraform are containers for multiple resources that are used together. They allow code reusability and abstraction of infrastructure configurations for scalability and consistency.

### 10. **What is `terraform plan`?**

-   **Answer**: `terraform plan` is a command that previews changes that Terraform will make to the infrastructure. It shows what actions Terraform will take without actually applying any changes.

### 11. **What is `terraform apply`?**

-   **Answer**: `terraform apply` is a command that executes the planned changes to the infrastructure as defined in the configuration files, based on the Terraform state.

### 12. **What is CloudFormation?**

-   **Answer**: CloudFormation is Amazon Web Services’ (AWS) IaC tool, which allows you to define, provision, and manage AWS resources using JSON or YAML templates.

### 13. **Explain the role of a “playbook” in Ansible.**

-   **Answer**: In Ansible, a playbook is a YAML file containing a series of tasks to be executed on remote servers, defining the desired state of the infrastructure.

### 14. **How does IaC enable version control?**

-   **Answer**: IaC configurations are stored in code files, which can be version-controlled in repositories like Git. This enables tracking changes, collaborating with others, and rolling back configurations if needed.

### 15. **What is the role of `tfvars` files in Terraform?**

-   **Answer**: `.tfvars` files in Terraform store variable values used in configuration files. They allow for separating variable data from the main configuration, making it easier to manage and reuse.

### 16. **What is Configuration Drift?**

-   **Answer**: Configuration drift occurs when the actual state of the infrastructure deviates from the state defined in IaC due to manual changes or other factors.

### 17. **How does Puppet differ from Ansible?**

-   **Answer**: Puppet uses a declarative approach and a pull-based configuration model, while Ansible uses a push-based model and can work in both declarative and imperative styles.

### 18. **What is a State Locking in Terraform?**

-   **Answer**: State locking in Terraform prevents multiple users from making concurrent changes to the same infrastructure. It’s commonly managed with remote state backends like AWS S3.

### 19. **What are Outputs in Terraform?**

-   **Answer**: Outputs in Terraform allow you to define values that will be displayed to the user after an `apply` operation, which can be used for cross-referencing resources between configurations.

### 20. **How does IaC facilitate disaster recovery?**

-   **Answer**: IaC configurations can be version-controlled and stored in repositories, allowing for quick re-deployment of infrastructure in case of disaster.

### 21. **What is “Infrastructure as Code testing”?**

-   **Answer**: It is the process of validating IaC configurations to ensure they meet desired criteria, which can involve linting, syntax validation, and functional tests for configuration accuracy.

### 22. **What is a Resource Graph in Terraform?**

-   **Answer**: A resource graph is a visual representation of dependencies between resources in a Terraform configuration, helping Terraform determine the order of operations.

### 23. **Can you explain the purpose of AWS CloudFormation stacks?**

-   **Answer**: A stack in AWS CloudFormation is a collection of AWS resources that can be managed, updated, and deleted as a single unit based on a CloudFormation template.

### 24. **What is `terraform init`?**

-   **Answer**: `terraform init` is the command to initialize a Terraform working directory, downloading provider plugins and preparing the environment for further commands.

### 25. **What is a Manifest in Kubernetes?**

-   **Answer**: A Kubernetes manifest is a YAML or JSON configuration file that defines the desired state of Kubernetes resources, such as Pods, Deployments, and Services.
