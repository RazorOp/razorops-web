-   **Answer**: Continuous testing involves automated testing at every stage of the CI/CD pipeline to ensure quality and reduce manual testing efforts.

### 20. **What are the benefits of using GitLab CI over Jenkins?**

-   **Answer**: GitLab CI offers seamless integration with GitLab repositories, built-in features, and often simpler setup than Jenkins.

### 21. **Explain the difference between CI and CD.**

-   **Answer**: CI focuses on code integration and testing, while CD extends to automated deployment, either continuously delivering to a repository or deploying to production.

### 22. **What is a YAML file in CI/CD?**

-   **Answer**: YAML files are commonly used to define pipeline configurations in CI/CD, as they are readable and compatible with many CI/CD tools.

### 23. **What is an artifact in CI/CD?**

-   **Answer**: Artifacts are files created during the build process, often used in deployment or testing, such as executables or code packages.

### 24. **What is CodeDeploy?**

-   **Answer**: AWS CodeDeploy automates application deployment to various compute services like EC2, Lambda, and on-premises servers.

### 25. **What is meant by a self-hosted CI/CD tool?**

-   **Answer**: Self-hosted CI/CD tools are hosted on-premises or on private cloud servers, giving more control over infrastructure.

### 26. **What are environment variables in CI/CD?**

-   **Answer**: Environment variables are configuration values stored in the CI/CD system and used within pipelines for flexibility and security.

### 27. **What is the purpose of caching in CI/CD?**

-   **Answer**: Caching in CI/CD saves previously downloaded dependencies or built components, reducing time for repeated tasks.

### 28. **Explain “pipeline as code” using GitLab CI/CD.**

-   **Answer**: In GitLab CI/CD, pipelines are defined in `.gitlab-ci.yml`, allowing version control and reusability of pipeline steps.
