### 1.  **What is a Version Control System (VCS)?**

-   **Answer**: A VCS is a tool that helps manage changes to source code or files, tracking history, merging updates, and enabling collaboration.

### 2.  **Why use Version Control Systems?**

-   **Answer**: To keep track of code changes, collaborate with team members, revert to previous versions, and maintain a history of changes.

### 3.  **What are the types of Version Control Systems?**

-   **Answer**:
    -   **Centralized VCS**: e.g., SVN, where all version history is stored in a central server.
    -   **Distributed VCS**: e.g., Git, where each developer has a full copy of the repository.

### 4.  **What is Git?**

-   **Answer**: Git is a distributed VCS that is widely used for tracking changes in source code during software development.

### 5.  **How is Git different from SVN?**

-   **Answer**: Git is distributed, allowing each developer to have a full repository copy, while SVN is centralized.

### 6.  **What is a repository in Git?**

-   **Answer**: A repository is a storage location for your project’s files, including the complete history of changes.

### 7.  **What is a commit in Git?**

-   **Answer**: A commit is a snapshot of the project’s changes at a specific point in time, stored in the repository.

### 8.  **What does  `git init`  do?**

-   **Answer**: Initializes a new Git repository in the current directory.

### 9.  **How do you check the status of your Git repository?**

-   **Answer**: By running  `git status`.

### 10.  **What is a branch in Git?**

-   **Answer**: A branch is a parallel line of development.  `master`  or  `main`  is the default branch.

### 11.  **What is the purpose of branches?**

-   **Answer**: To isolate code changes for features, bug fixes, or experiments, allowing developers to work independently.

### 12.  **How do you create a new branch?**

-   **Answer**:  `git branch branch_name`

### 13.  **How do you switch to another branch?**

-   **Answer**:  `git checkout branch_name`  or  `git switch branch_name`

### 14.  **How do you create and switch to a new branch in one command?**

-   **Answer**:  `git checkout -b branch_name`

### 15.  **What is  `git merge`?**

-   **Answer**: Combines changes from one branch into another branch.

### 16.  **What are merge conflicts?**

-   **Answer**: Occur when changes in different branches clash and need manual resolution.

### 17.  **How do you resolve a merge conflict in Git?**

-   **Answer**: Open the conflicting files, manually resolve conflicts, and then  `git add`  the resolved files.

### 18.  **What is  `git rebase`?**

-   **Answer**: Reapplies commits on top of another base tip, providing a cleaner project history.

### 19.  **When would you use  `git rebase`  instead of  `git merge`?**

-   **Answer**: Use  `git rebase`  to maintain a linear project history.

### 20.  **What does  `git pull`  do?**

-   **Answer**: Fetches changes from a remote repository and merges them into the current branch.

### 21.  **What does  `git fetch`  do?**

-   **Answer**: Downloads changes from a remote repository but does not merge them into your local branch.

### 22.  **How do you push changes to a remote repository?**

-   **Answer**:  `git push origin branch_name`

### 23.  **What is a remote repository?**

-   **Answer**: A version of your project hosted on the internet or a network for collaboration.

### 24.  **What is  `git clone`  used for?**

-   **Answer**: Creates a local copy of a remote repository.

### 25.  **How do you remove a file from the staging area without deleting it from the working directory?**

-   **Answer**:  `git reset HEAD file_name`

### 26.  **How do you view the commit history?**

-   **Answer**:  `git log`

### 27.  **What is  `git stash`  used for?**

-   **Answer**: Temporarily saves uncommitted changes, cleaning the working directory.

### 28.  **How do you apply stashed changes?**

-   **Answer**:  `git stash apply`

### 29.  **How do you delete a branch in Git?**

-   **Answer**:  `git branch -d branch_name`  for a merged branch;  `git branch -D branch_name`  for an unmerged branch.

### 30.  **What is  `.gitignore`?**

-   **Answer**: A file that specifies intentionally untracked files to ignore.

### 31.  **What is  `git diff`?**

-   **Answer**: Shows differences between files in the working directory and the index or a commit.

### 32.  **What does  `git reset`  do?**

-   **Answer**: Undoes changes by moving the HEAD to a specified state, modifying the staging area and working directory.

### 33.  **What is  `git cherry-pick`?**

-   **Answer**: Applies a specific commit from one branch onto another.

### 34.  **What is  `git tag`?**

-   **Answer**: Used to mark specific points in history as important, usually for releases.

### 35.  **What is a fork in GitHub?**
