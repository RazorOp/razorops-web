**1.  What is monitoring?**
    

Monitoring is the regular observation and recording of activities taking place in a project or system. It involves collecting data on various metrics to ensure the system operates correctly.

**2.  What is observability?**
    

Observability refers to the capability of the system to allow insight into its internal state based on the outputs (logs, metrics, and traces) it produces.

**3.  What are the primary components of observability?**
    

The primary components are logs, metrics, and traces.

**4.  What is the difference between monitoring and observability?**
    

Monitoring is about collecting and analyzing predefined metrics and logs to ensure system health. Observability is broader, focusing on understanding the internal state of the system through its outputs, enabling more dynamic and proactive insights.

**5.  What are metrics in monitoring?**
    

Metrics are quantitative data points collected over time to measure the performance of a system, such as CPU usage, memory usage, and request rates.

**6.  What are logs in monitoring?**
    

Logs are records of discrete events that happen over time within a system. They provide detailed information about system behavior and errors.

**7.  How do you differentiate between structured and unstructured logs?**
    

Structured logs are logs with a consistent and predictable format, often in JSON. Unstructured logs are free-form and can vary in format, making them harder to parse and analyze.

**8.  What is a service-level agreement (SLA)?**
    

An SLA is a contract between a service provider and a customer that defines the level of service expected, including uptime, performance benchmarks, and issue resolution times.

**9.  What is distributed tracing?**
    

Distributed tracing is a method used to monitor applications built on a microservices architecture. It tracks requests as they move through various services, helping to identify where failures or performance bottlenecks occur.

**10.  How does a trace differ from a log?**
    

A trace provides a sequence of events or spans that track the lifecycle of a request as it traverses multiple services. Logs are discrete events recorded in a system.

**11.  What is a span in distributed tracing?**
    

A span represents a single operation within a trace, including metadata such as start time, duration, and any associated tags or annotations.
