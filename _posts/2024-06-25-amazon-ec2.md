**What is AWS EC2?**

● EC2 stands for Elastic Compute Cloud.

● Amazon EC2 is the virtual machine in the Cloud Environment.

● Amazon EC2 provides scalable capacity. Instances can scale up and down automatically based on the traffic.

● You do not have to invest in the hardware.

● You can launch as many servers as you want and you will have complete control over the servers and can manage security, networking, and storage.


**Instance Type:**

  

● Instance type is providing a range of instance types for various use cases.

● The instance is the processor and memory of your EC2 instance.

**EBS Volume:**

● EBS Stands for Elastic Block Storage.

● It is the block-level storage that is assigned to your single EC2 Instance.

● It persists independently from running EC2.

**Types of EBS Storage**

▪ General Purpose (SSD)

▪ Provisioned IOPS (SSD)

▪ Throughput Optimized Hard Disk Drive

▪ Cold Hard Disk Drive

▪ Magnetic

**Instance Store:** Instance store is the ephemeral block-level storage for the EC2 instance.

● Instance stores can be used for faster processing and temporary storage of the application.

**AMI:** AMI Stands for **Amazon Machine Image**.

● AMI decides the OS, installs dependencies, libraries, data of your EC2 instances.

● Multiple instances with the same configuration can be launched using a single AMI.

**Security Group:** A Security group acts as a virtual firewall for your EC2 Instances.

● It decides the type of port and kind of traffic to allow.

● Security groups are active at the instance level whereas Network ACLs are active at the subnet level.

● Security Groups can only allow but can’t deny the rules.

● The Security group is considered stateful.

● By default, in the outbound rule all traffic is allowed and needs to define the inbound rules.


**Key Pair:** A key pair, consisting of a private key and a public key, is a set of security credentials that you can use to prove your identity while connecting to an instance.
