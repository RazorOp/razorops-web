**What is AWS Cost Explorer?**

AWS Cost Explorer is a UI-tool that enables users to analyze the costs and usage with the help of a graph, the Cost Explorer cost and usage reports, and/or the Cost
Explorer RI report. It can be accessed from the Billing and Cost Management console.

It provides default reports for analysis with some filters and constraints to create the reports. Analysis using Cost Explorer can be saved as a bookmark, CSV file download, or save them as a report.

The default reports provided by Cost Explorer are:

**● Cost and usage reports:**

It provides the following data for understanding the costs:-

○ AWS Marketplace

○ Daily costs

○ Monthly costs by linked account

○ Monthly costs by service

○ Monthly EC2 running hours costs and usage

**● Reserved Instance reports:**

It provides the following reports for understanding the reservations:-

○ **RI utilization reports:** It gives information about how much costs are saved or overspent by using Reserved Instances (RIs).

○ **RI coverage reports:** It gives information about how many hours are saved or overspent by using Reserved Instances (RIs).

● The first time that the user signs up for Cost Explorer, it directs through the main parts of the console. It prepares the data regarding costs & usage and displays up to 12 months of historical data (might be less if less used),
current month data, and then calculates the forecast data for the next 12 months.

● It uses the same set of data that is used to generate the AWS Cost and Usage Reports and the billing reports.

● It provides a custom time period to view the data at a monthly or daily interval.

● It provides a feature of Savings Plans which provides savings of up to 72% on the AWS compute usage.

● It provides a way to access the data programmatically using the Cost Explorer API.
