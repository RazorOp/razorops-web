DevOps is a set of practices that combines software development (Dev) and IT operations (Ops) to shorten the development lifecycle and provide continuous delivery.

**22.  What is CI/CD?**
    

Continuous Integration (CI) and Continuous Deployment (CD) are practices that improve software development by automating testing and deployment.

**23.  What is Docker?**
    

Docker is a tool designed to make it easier to create, deploy, and run applications by using containers.

**24.  What is Kubernetes?**
    

Kubernetes is an open-source system for automating deployment, scaling, and management of containerized applications.

**25.  What is Terraform?**
    

Terraform is an open-source infrastructure as code software tool that provides a consistent CLI workflow to manage hundreds of cloud services.

**26.  What is a microservices architecture?**
    

Microservices architecture is a style that structures an application as a collection of loosely coupled services, which implement business capabilities.

**27.  What is a serverless architecture?**
    

Serverless architecture is a way to build and run applications and services without having to manage infrastructure.

**28.  What is an API Gateway?**
    

An API Gateway acts as a reverse proxy to accept all application programming interface (API) calls, aggregate the various services required to fulfill them, and return the appropriate result.

**29.  What is load balancing?**
    

Load balancing is the process of distributing network or application traffic across multiple servers.

**30.  What is auto-scaling?**
    

Auto-scaling is a cloud computing feature that automatically adjusts the number of active servers to match the current load.

**31.  What is cloud monitoring?**
