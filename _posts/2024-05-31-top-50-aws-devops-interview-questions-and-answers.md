Use Amazon CloudWatch to collect and track metrics, collect and monitor log files, and set alarms.

**21.  What is AWS Lambda?**
    

AWS Lambda lets you run code without provisioning or managing servers. You pay only for the compute time you consume.

**22.  What are AWS IAM roles?**
    

AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM) roles are a set of permissions that define what actions are allowed and denied by an entity in AWS.

**23.  What is the difference between IAM roles and IAM policies?**
    

IAM roles are sets of permissions that AWS resources can assume. IAM policies are JSON documents that define permissions for an entity.

**24.  How do you manage secrets in AWS?**
    

Use AWS Secrets Manager or AWS Systems Manager Parameter Store to manage secrets.

**25.  What is Amazon Route 53?**

**26.  What is a VPC?**
    

Amazon Virtual Private Cloud (VPC) lets you provision a logically isolated section of the AWS cloud where you can launch AWS resources in a virtual network you define.

**27.  What are the components of a VPC?**
    

Components include subnets, route tables, internet gateways, NAT gateways, and security groups.

**28.  What is an AMI?**
    

An Amazon Machine Image (AMI) provides the information required to launch an instance, which is a virtual server in the cloud.
