**This Privacy Policy is effective as of February 1, 2026.**

Welcome, and thank you for your interest in Razorops AI Labs Pvt Ltd ("Razorops," "us," or "we") and our AI-powered Kubernetes performance and cost optimization platform (the "Service"), as described in the Razorops Terms of Service.

This Privacy Policy describes the information that we gather from you, how we use and disclose your information, and the steps we take to protect your information. By using or accessing the Site or the Service, you are accepting the practices described in this Privacy Policy, and you are consenting to our processing of your information as set forth in this Privacy Policy now and as amended by us. If you have any questions or comments about this Privacy Policy or our use of your personally identifying information, please contact us at hello@razorops.com. This Privacy Policy is incorporated into and is subject to the Razorops Terms of Service. Capitalized terms that are not defined in the Privacy Policy have the meaning given to them in the Terms of Service.

## Information We Collect

### User-Provided Information

When you use the Service, you may provide and we may collect what is generally called "personally identifiable" information, such as your name, e-mail address, company name, mobile phone number, and demographic information. For example, you may provide us with personally identifiable information when you register for an account, request beta access, connect your Kubernetes clusters, configure optimization settings, or send us customer service related requests.

We collect and store content that you create, input, submit, post, upload, transmit, store or display in the process of using our Site or Service ("Customer Data"). Such Content includes any personal information or other sensitive information that you choose to include ("incidentally-collected Personal Information").

### Kubernetes Cluster Data

To provide our AI-powered optimization services, we collect and analyze data from your connected Kubernetes clusters, including but not limited to:

- Resource utilization metrics (CPU, memory, storage)
- Pod and container configurations
- Workload patterns and scaling events
- Cost and billing data from cloud providers (with your authorization)
- Application performance metrics
- Namespace and deployment configurations

This data is used exclusively to provide optimization recommendations and automated tuning of your infrastructure. We do not access or store your application code, secrets, or sensitive workload data unless explicitly required and authorized by you.

### Analytics Information

Analytics information also consists of data we collect as a result of running queries against Customer Data across our user base for the purposes of generating Usage Data. "Usage Data" is aggregated data about a group or category of services, features, or users that does not contain Personal Information. For example, we may query Customer Data to determine the most common types of Kubernetes workloads, optimization patterns, or resource configurations in order to improve our AI models and better understand usage trends. Though we may happen upon sensitive or personal information as we compile Usage Data from Customer Data across user instances, this is a byproduct of our efforts to understand broader patterns and trends. It is not a concerted effort by us to examine the Customer Data of any particular customer.

### Cookies Information

We and our partners, affiliates, or analytics or service providers use technologies such as cookies, beacons, tags and scripts to analyze trends, administer the Site, track user's movements around the Site, and to gather demographic information about our user base as a whole. When you use the Service, we may send one or more cookies - small text files containing a string of alphanumeric characters - to your computer. We may use both session cookies and persistent cookies. A session cookie disappears after you close your browser. A persistent cookie remains after you close your browser and may be used by your browser on subsequent visits to the Service. Persistent cookies can be removed. Please review your web browser "Help" file to learn the proper way to modify your cookie settings. Please note that if you delete, or choose not to accept, cookies from the Service, you may not be able to utilize the features of the Service to their fullest potential.

### Automatically Collected Information

When you use the Service or open one of our HTML e-mails, we may automatically record certain information from your web browser by using different types of technology, including "clear gifs" or "web beacons." This "automatically collected" information may include your IP address or other device address or ID, web browser and/or device type, the web pages or sites that you visit just before or just after the Service, the pages you view on the Service, and the dates and times that you visit, access, or use the Service. This information is gathered for all users.

**Web Logs:** As is true with most websites and services delivered over the Internet, we gather certain information and store it in log files when you interact with our Sites and Services. This information includes internet protocol (IP) addresses as well as browser type, internet service provider, URLs of referring/exit pages, operating system, date/time stamp, information you search for, locale and language preferences, identification numbers associated with your devices, your mobile carrier, and system configuration information.

## How We Use the Information We Collect

Your information is an integral part of our operations, and we use it in a variety of ways in providing the Service and operating our business. For example:

- We use the information that you provide or that we collect to operate, maintain, enhance and provide all of the features of the Service, including AI-powered Kubernetes optimization and cost recommendations.
- We will use all of the information that you provide and that we collect to understand and analyze the usage trends and preferences of our users, to improve the Service, to train and improve our AI models, and to create new features and functionality.
- We may use your e-mail address or other personal information (a) to contact you for administrative purposes such as customer service, to address intellectual property infringement, right of privacy violations or defamation issues related to your Customer Data posted on the Service or (b) to send you promotional messages related to the Service and the activities of third parties we work with. Generally, you have the ability to opt-out of receiving any such communications, either through links provided in the messages or by updating your account preferences through the Service.
- We may use "cookies" information and "automatically collected" information to: (a) personalize our services, such as remembering your information so that you will not have to re-enter it during your visit or the next time you visit the Service; (b) provide customized content and information; (c) monitor and analyze the effectiveness of Service and third party marketing activities; and (d) monitor aggregate site usage metrics such as total number of visitors and pages viewed.
- We use information to process and complete transactions, and send you related information, including purchase confirmations and invoices.
- We may use information to investigate and prevent fraudulent transactions, unauthorized access to Services, and other illegal activities.
- We use information to enable you to communicate, collaborate, and share Customer Data with users you designate; and for other purposes about which we obtain your consent.

## When We Disclose Information

We will not share or disclose any of your information or Customer Data with third parties except as described in this policy. **We do not sell your information or Customer Data.**

We disclose your personally identifiable information in a variety of circumstances in connection with providing the Service and the operation of our business. For example:

- Any information, including personally identifiable information, that you voluntarily choose to include in a publicly accessible area of the Service will be available to anyone who has access to that content, including other users.
- We work with third party service providers to provide website, application development, hosting, maintenance, back-up, storage, cloud infrastructure, payment processing, analysis and other services for us. To the extent it is necessary for these third party service providers to complete their contractual obligations to us, these third parties may have access to or process your information. Generally, these disclosures are made under terms comparable to this policy, and the recipients are limited to using the information for the purpose for which it was provided.
- You may choose to make use of third party integrations in conjunction with Services (such as cloud provider integrations for AWS, Google Cloud, Azure, etc.). Third party integration policies and procedures are not controlled by Razorops. This Privacy Policy does not cover the collection or use of your data by third party integrations, and we urge you to consider the privacy policies governing third party services.
- We make certain automatically collected and other aggregate non-personally-identifiable information available to third parties, to: (i) comply with various reporting obligations; (ii) for business or marketing purposes; or (iii) to assist such parties in understanding our users' interests, habits, and usage patterns for certain programs, content, services, advertisements, promotions, and/or functionality available through the Service.
- We may disclose your information if required (a) to enforce our agreements, policies and terms of service, (b) to protect the security or integrity of Razorops's products and services, (c) to protect Razorops, our customers or the public from harm or illegal activities, or (d) to respond to an emergency which we believe in good faith requires us to disclose information to assist in preventing the death or serious bodily injury of any person.

## Your Choices

You may, of course, decline to share certain personally identifiable information with us, in which case we may not be able to provide to you some of the features and functionality of the Service. You may update, correct, or delete your profile information and preferences at any time by accessing your account preferences page through the Service.

Please note that while your changes are reflected promptly in active user databases, we may retain all information you submit for a variety of purposes, including backups and archiving, prevention of fraud and abuse, and analytics.

You may opt out of receiving promotional communications from Razorops by using the unsubscribe link within each email, updating your email preferences within your Service account settings menu, or emailing us to have your contact information removed from our promotional email list. Although opt-out requests are usually processed immediately, please allow ten (10) business days for a removal request to be processed. Even after you opt out from receiving promotional messages from us, you will continue to receive transactional messages from us regarding the Services.

## Data Retention

We retain your account information for as long as your account is active, or as reasonably useful for commercial purposes or as necessary to comply with our legal obligations, resolve disputes, and enforce our agreements. You can request deletion of your data by contacting us at hello@razorops.com.

## Third Party Services

The Service may contain features or links to websites and services provided by third parties. Any personally identifiable information you provide on third party sites or services is provided directly to that third party and is subject to that third party's policies, if any, governing privacy and security, even if accessed through the Service. We are not responsible for the content or privacy and security practices and policies of third party sites or services to which links or access are provided through the Service. We encourage you to learn about third parties' privacy and security policies before providing them with personally identifiable information.

## Social Media Widgets

The Site and the Service may include social media features, such as the Twitter button, LinkedIn button, and widgets, such as the Share button or interactive mini-programs. These features may collect your IP address, which page you are visiting on the Site, and may set a cookie to enable the feature to function properly. Social media features and widgets are either hosted by a third party or hosted directly on the Site or the Service. Your interactions with these features are governed by the privacy policy of the company providing it.

## Our Commitment to Children's Privacy

Protecting the privacy of young children is especially important. For that reason, we do not allow children under 13 years-of-age to use the Service or knowingly collect or maintain personally identifiable information from persons under 13 years-of-age, and no part of the Service is directed to persons under 13 years-of-age. If you are under 13 years-of-age, then please do not use or access Service at any time or in any manner. If we learn that personally identifiable information has been collected on the Service from persons under 13 years-of-age and without verifiable parental consent, then we will take the appropriate steps to delete this information. If you are a parent or guardian and discover that your child under 13 years-of-age has obtained an account on the Service, then you may alert us at hello@razorops.com and request that we delete that child's personally identifiable information from our systems.

## Our Commitment to Data Security

We use certain physical, managerial, and technical safeguards that are designed to improve the integrity and security of your personally identifiable information. We cannot, however, ensure or warrant the security of any information you transmit to us or store on the Service and you do so at your own risk. We also cannot guarantee that such information may not be accessed, disclosed, altered, or destroyed by breach of any of our physical, technical, or managerial safeguards.

**Security Measures:**

- All data transmitted to and from our Service is encrypted using TLS 1.3
- We follow industry-standard security practices for data storage and processing
- Regular security audits and penetration testing
- Access controls and authentication for all systems
- Data encryption at rest for sensitive information

If we learn of a security systems breach, then we may attempt to notify you electronically so that you can take appropriate protective steps. We may post a notice through the Service if a security breach occurs. Depending on where you live, you may have a legal right to receive notice of a security breach in writing. To receive a free written notice of a security breach you should notify us at hello@razorops.com.

## International Data Transfers

If you are accessing our Service from outside India, please be aware that your information may be transferred to, stored, and processed in India where our servers are located. By using the Service, you consent to the transfer of information to India, which may have different data protection rules than those of your country.

For users in the European Economic Area (EEA), we comply with applicable data protection laws and ensure appropriate safeguards are in place for international data transfers.

## In the Event of Merger or Sale

In the event that all or a portion of Razorops AI Labs Pvt Ltd or its assets are acquired by or merged with a third party entity, we reserve the right, in any of these circumstances, to transfer or assign the information that we have collected from users in connection with such merger, acquisition, sale, or other change of control. In such event you will be notified via email and/or a prominent notice on the Site or through the Service of any such change in ownership or uses of your information, as well as any choices you may have regarding your information.

## Changes and Updates to this Privacy Policy
