      <p><strong>This Privacy Policy is effective as of March 1, 2026.</strong></p>
      <p>Welcome, and thank you for your interest in Razorops AI Labs Pvt Ltd (&quot;Razorops,&quot; &quot;us,&quot; or &quot;we&quot;) and our AI-powered Kubernetes performance and cost optimization platform (the &quot;Service&quot;), as described in the Razorops Terms of Service.</p>
      <p>This Privacy Policy describes the information that we gather from you, how we use and disclose your information, and the steps we take to protect your information. By using or accessing the Site or the Service, you are accepting the practices described in this Privacy Policy, and you are consenting to our processing of your information as set forth in this Privacy Policy now and as amended by us. If you have any questions or comments about this Privacy Policy or our use of your personally identifying information, please contact us at hello@razorops.com. This Privacy Policy is incorporated into and is subject to the Razorops Terms of Service. Capitalized terms that are not defined in the Privacy Policy have the meaning given to them in the Terms of Service.</p>
      <h2 id="information-we-collect">Information We Collect</h2>
      <h3 id="user-provided-information">User-Provided Information</h3>
      <p>When you use the Service, you may provide and we may collect what is generally called &quot;personally identifiable&quot; information, such as your name, e-mail address, company name, mobile phone number, and demographic information. For example, you may provide us with personally identifiable information when you register for an account, request beta access, connect your Kubernetes clusters, configure optimization settings, or send us customer service related requests.</p>
      <p>We collect and store content that you create, input, submit, post, upload, transmit, store or display in the process of using our Site or Service (&quot;Customer Data&quot;). Such Content includes any personal information or other sensitive information that you choose to include (&quot;incidentally-collected Personal Information&quot;).</p>
      <h3 id="kubernetes-cluster-data">Kubernetes Cluster Data</h3>
      <p>To provide our AI-powered optimization services, we collect and analyze data from your connected Kubernetes clusters, including but not limited to:</p>
      <ul>
      <li>Resource utilization metrics (CPU, memory, storage)</li>
      <li>Pod and container configurations</li>
      <li>Workload patterns and scaling events</li>
      <li>Cost and billing data from cloud providers (with your authorization)</li>
      <li>Application performance metrics</li>
      <li>Namespace and deployment configurations</li>
      </ul>
      <p>This data is used exclusively to provide optimization recommendations and automated tuning of your infrastructure. We do not access or store your application code, secrets, or sensitive workload data unless explicitly required and authorized by you.</p>
      <h3 id="analytics-information">Analytics Information</h3>
      <p>Analytics information also consists of data we collect as a result of running queries against Customer Data across our user base for the purposes of generating Usage Data. &quot;Usage Data&quot; is aggregated data about a group or category of services, features, or users that does not contain Personal Information. For example, we may query Customer Data to determine the most common types of Kubernetes workloads, optimization patterns, or resource configurations in order to improve our AI models and better understand usage trends. Though we may happen upon sensitive or personal information as we compile Usage Data from Customer Data across user instances, this is a byproduct of our efforts to understand broader patterns and trends. It is not a concerted effort by us to examine the Customer Data of any particular customer.</p>
      <h3 id="cookies-information">Cookies Information</h3>
      <p>We and our partners, affiliates, or analytics or service providers use technologies such as cookies, beacons, tags and scripts to analyze trends, administer the Site, track user&#39;s movements around the Site, and to gather demographic information about our user base as a whole. When you use the Service, we may send one or more cookies - small text files containing a string of alphanumeric characters - to your computer. We may use both session cookies and persistent cookies. A session cookie disappears after you close your browser. A persistent cookie remains after you close your browser and may be used by your browser on subsequent visits to the Service. Persistent cookies can be removed. Please review your web browser &quot;Help&quot; file to learn the proper way to modify your cookie settings. Please note that if you delete, or choose not to accept, cookies from the Service, you may not be able to utilize the features of the Service to their fullest potential.</p>
      <h3 id="automatically-collected-information">Automatically Collected Information</h3>
      <p>When you use the Service or open one of our HTML e-mails, we may automatically record certain information from your web browser by using different types of technology, including &quot;clear gifs&quot; or &quot;web beacons.&quot; This &quot;automatically collected&quot; information may include your IP address or other device address or ID, web browser and/or device type, the web pages or sites that you visit just before or just after the Service, the pages you view on the Service, and the dates and times that you visit, access, or use the Service. This information is gathered for all users.</p>
      <p><strong>Web Logs:</strong> As is true with most websites and services delivered over the Internet, we gather certain information and store it in log files when you interact with our Sites and Services. This information includes internet protocol (IP) addresses as well as browser type, internet service provider, URLs of referring/exit pages, operating system, date/time stamp, information you search for, locale and language preferences, identification numbers associated with your devices, your mobile carrier, and system configuration information.</p>
