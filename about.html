<p class="large margin-top-small">
  Razorops is a complete container native CI/CD solution handling all aspects of the software lifecycle from the moment a commit is created until it is deployed to production.<br>
  Razorops has all the capabilities that you would expect from a CI/CD platform such as<br>
  1. Code compilation/build<br>
  2. Artifact packaging<br>
  3. Testing Automation(unit, integration, acceptance etc.)<br>
  4. Faster builds and shipping to production<br><br>
  Razorops is a single solution that implements the whole pipeline from start to deployment.

	<h3>Docker Support</h3>
	<p>Razorops has embraced Docker support right from its inception. All Razorops capabilities revolve around Docker images. Razorops is especially powerful when it comes to creating Docker images (Docker as a service), annotating them and storing them for later usage.</p>

<div class="col-sm-4">
	<h3>Kubernetes support</h3>
	<p>In a similar manner to Docker, Razorops comes with dedicated support for Kubernetes deployments. Razorops offers an explicit Kubernetes deployment step that can be used in a pipeline to deploy a docker image to any Kubernetes cluster regardless of its underlying implementation (Google, Aws, Azure etc).</p>
</div>


<div class="col-sm-4">
	<h3>Helm support</h3>
	<p>Helm is a package manager for Kubernetes and is quickly becoming the preferred way to deploy K8s applications. It can group associated application services in packages (called Charts) and can also version and rollback application deployments, making releases much less painful.</p>

<h2>Our Mission</h2>

Our main focus is to increase developer productivity and makes software deployment faster, easier and better.


<h2>Our Story</h2>

We started razorops as two people and are now 10+ strong. which helps development teams to automate their CI/CD workflow and streamline delivery pipeline to various environments like QA, staging & production.

Need of building quality software and shipping it quickly has become the core requirement for each business. We designed and built Razorops platform for microservices and container native applications. We utilize existing modern systems to achieve our goals.
