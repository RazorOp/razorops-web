  Razorops is a complete container native CI/CD solution handling all aspects of the software lifecycle from the moment a commit is created until it is deployed to production.<br>
  Razorops has all the capabilities that you would expect from a CI/CD platform such as<br>
  1. Code compilation/build<br>
  2. Artifact packaging<br>
  3. Testing Automation(unit, integration, acceptance etc.)<br>
  4. Faster builds and shipping to production<br><br>
  Razorops is a single solution that implements the whole pipeline from start to deployment.
