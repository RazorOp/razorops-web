	<p> Razorops is a complete container native CI/CD solution handling all aspects of the software lifecycle from the moment a commit is created until it is deployed to production.

Razorops has all the capabilities that you would expect from a CI/CD platform such as

* Code compilation/build
* Artifact packaging
* Testing Automation(unit, integration, acceptance etc.)
* Faster builds and shipping to production

Razorops is a single solution that implements the whole pipeline from start to deployment.
