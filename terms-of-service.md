      <h2 class="f4 lh-title mv4">20. General provisions</h2>
      <p>The Terms of Service (including the Policies, and together with any Primary Agreement) are the entire agreement between Customer and Razorops with respect to the Site and Services, and supersede all prior or contemporaneous communications and proposals (whether oral, written or electronic) between Customer and Razorops with respect to the Services. If any provision of the Terms of Service is found to be unenforceable or invalid, that provision will be limited or eliminated to the minimum extent necessary so that the Terms of Service will otherwise remain in full force and effect and enforceable.</p>
      <p>Customer’s rights and obligations under the Terms of Service are personal to Customer, and are not assignable, transferable or sublicensable by Customer except with Razorops’ prior written consent. Razorops may assign, transfer, subcontract or delegate this Agreement and/or any or all of its rights and obligations hereunder without consent. All waivers, consents and modifications must be in a writing signed by both parties, except as otherwise provided herein. The failure of either party to enforce its rights under this Agreement at any time or for any period (including without limitation, Razorops’ failure to enforce any use restriction) will not be construed as a waiver of such rights. No agency, partnership, joint venture, or employment relationship is created as a result of the Service or Terms of Service, and neither party has any authority of any kind to bind the other in any respect. All notices under this Agreement will be in writing and will be deemed to have been duly given when received, if personally delivered or sent by certified or registered mail, return receipt requested; when receipt is electronically confirmed, if transmitted by facsimile or e-mail; or the day after it is sent, if sent for next day delivery by recognized overnight delivery service.</p>
