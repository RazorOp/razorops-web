# We are RazorOps

RazorOps is a complete container native CI/CD solution handling all aspects of the software lifecycle from the moment a commit is created until it is deployed to production.

RazorOps has all the capabilities that you would expect from a CI platform such as

1. Code compilation
1. Artifact packaging
1. Testing (unit, integration, acceptance etc.)
1. Branch management
1. Pull request handling



RazorOps is a single solution that implements the whole pipeline from start to deployment. Following are some of container native features.


**Docker Support**


RazorOps has embraced Docker support right from its inception. All RazorOps capabilities revolve around Docker images. RazorOps is especially powerful when it comes to creating Docker images (Docker as a service), annotating them and storing them for later usage.




**Kubernetes support**


In a similar manner to Docker, RazorOps comes with dedicated support for Kubernetes deployments. RazorOps offers an explicit Kubernetes deployment step that can be used in a pipeline to deploy a docker image to any Kubernetes cluster regardless of its underlying implementation (Google, Aws, Azure etc).

RazorOps also offers a graphical way to manage a Kubernetes cluster with everything that you would expect, such as support for namespaces.


**Helm support**

Helm is a package manager for Kubernetes and is quickly becoming the preferred way to deploy K8s applications. It can group associated application services in packages (called Charts) and can also version and rollback application deployments, making releases much less painful.

Helm is another area where RazorOps support really shines. Like Kubernetes and Docker, RazorOps has explicit support for Helm repos and deployments. You can see the Helm releases from within the RazorOps UI as well as browse the available Helm Charts.

**Our mission**

Automate and simplify scalable system deployment



# Our Story
Need of building quality software and shipping it quickly has become the core requirement for each business.  We designed and built the RazorOps platform for microservices and container native applications . Our main focus was to scale application within no time, we utilize existing modern systems to achive our goles.



> Quality software deserves better tools.
