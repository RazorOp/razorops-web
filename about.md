Razorops is a complete container native CI/CD solution handling all aspects of the software lifecycle from the moment a commit is created until it is deployed to production.

Razorops has all the capabilities that you would expect from a CI/CD platform such as

* Code compilation/build
* Artifact packaging
* Testing Automation(unit, integration, acceptance etc.)
* Faster builds and shipping to production

Razorops is a single solution that implements the whole pipeline from start to deployment. Following are some of container native features.

	<h3>Docker Support</h3>
	<p>Razorops has embraced Docker support right from its inception. All Razorops capabilities revolve around Docker images. Razorops is especially powerful when it comes to creating Docker images (Docker as a service), annotating them and storing them for later usage.</p>
</div>

<div class="col-sm-4">
	<h3>Kubernetes support</h3>
	<p>In a similar manner to Docker, Razorops comes with dedicated support for Kubernetes deployments. Razorops offers an explicit Kubernetes deployment step that can be used in a pipeline to deploy a docker image to any Kubernetes cluster regardless of its underlying implementation (Google, Aws, Azure etc).</p>
</div>


<div class="col-sm-4">
	<h3>Helm support</h3>
	<p>Helm is a package manager for Kubernetes and is quickly becoming the preferred way to deploy K8s applications. It can group associated application services in packages (called Charts) and can also version and rollback application deployments, making releases much less painful.</p>
