# Setting up your first deployment pipeline

There are three steps you need to follow to set up a basic deployment pipeline.

1. Set up a build server
Build servers are also called continuous integration (CI) servers. You have a few options here, and each comes with its own advantages and disadvantages. It doesn't matter where you start, because they share the same basic functionality, and it's not usually too difficult to migrate to another one later. I've had success with Jenkins, go.cd, and TeamCity on various projects. The first two are open source, and all let you get started for free.
