# Prerequisite :
 
* An existing Razorops account
* Creating clusters on cloud AWS

**Github Repository :** <a href="https://github.com/Razorops-code/spring-boot.git" target="_blank">https://github.com/Razorops-code/spring-boot.git </a>

You can follow the these steps for creating AWS-EKS cluster <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/u/0/d/1ukZjk56PHb9Ny9x-pLexNWcQ9C77izZt9YgnvgyCHLU/edit" target="_blank"><b>click here</b></a>

After creating EKS cluster 


# Setting Up Cluster Access
To access a cluster using kubectl, you have to set up a Kubernetes configuration file (commonly known as a 'kubeconfig' file) for the cluster. The kubeconfig file (by default named config and stored in the $HOME/.kube directory) provides the necessary details to access the cluster. Having set up the kubeconfig file, you can start using kubectl to manage the cluster.  For razorops you can follow the process to access the cluster <a href="https://docs.razorops.com/guides/kubernetes/connect/" target="_blank"><b>Click here</b></a>


# Next sign in to razorops with working github account

![](/images/integration/razorops-dashboard.png)


# Next move to kubernetes section and click on Add New 
![]()

# Next you navigate to existing cluster 
Here you can add name for cluster and authentication method 

Here we can go with kubernetes ConfigFile (which is generated by connect <a href="https://docs.razorops.com/guides/kubernetes/connect/" target="_blank">credentials</a> )

![]()


# Here your config file looks like 

![]()


# Just copy and past at authentication section and click on Create Cluster

![]()


# Next your cluster will added to Razorops kubernetes section successfully show like 

![]()

**Cluster added process completed next move to workflow section for run a pipeline for deploy our application on to kubernetes eks cluster
**


# Now your in workflow dashboard
![]()


Next click on pipeline , you can navigate to the add a new pipeline dashboard 

# SELECT GITHUB

![]()


# SELECT REPOSITORY 

![]()

**And confirm it **

![]()


# Enter the razorops pipeline

# Next Run your first Build

# Next automatically 
* clone source code from repository  
* Build code with maven 
* Create image with dockerfile 
* Push the image from dockerhub repository
* Deploy the container on EKS cluster with kubernetes manifest file i.e (deployment.yml and service.yml )
* Access the application with NodePort ip service

**Successfully Sample-java-app pod up and running and works on NodePort-service- 31103**


<b>We can find <node-external-ip>:31103
In my case i.e  3.109.54.147:31103/spring3/
	Note:- This application working on tomcat server we need to mention application name i.e spring3</b>
