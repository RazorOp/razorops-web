# Roadmap from start to finish

Software artifacts are the backbone of software development as they provide developers with a roadmap for a program from start to finish. Without artifacts, it would be difficult to know which tools are necessary to build a fully functional program. This roadmap or template also allows teams to track the development process over time and find out whether workflows need to be adjusted to meet expectations, goals and deadlines.

**Time efficiency**

Software artifacts save time and thus, money. After all, nobody wants to develop a program that is already outdated by the time it’s ready to launch. This is why software artifacts should be at the center of the development process – they provide guidance and structure and help reduce the developers’ workload to fast-track certain steps and procedures. They also allow them to work around known bottlenecks and avoid common mistakes.

**Easy upgrades and reusability**

Once a program is ready to launch, it’s still not fully “finished” as every software needs updates for continuity. On average, a program will last for 3 to 5 years before it needs to be updated to maintain its functionality. Software artifacts facilitate this process. What is more, developers can also examine documentation, code, and other artifacts from past products to gather ideas and determine how to approach technical problems in new projects.

**Maintainability**

The upkeep of a program can take a lot of time and effort. Tasks range from fixing occasional errors or bugs that come up during usage over time, or solving problems that arise when new features are added or when the program is replaced entirely. When software artifacts are created, all these potential issues are being addressed which prolongs the duration of use and helps maintain the software in check.

**Developing prototypes**
