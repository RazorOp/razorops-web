Grunt is a JavaScript based task runner which means it can automate repetitive tasks in a workflow and it can be used as a command line tool for JavaScript objects. Grunt makes the workflow as easy as writing a setup file. You can automate repetitive tasks with minimum effort.
<br>

# How to use GRUNT tool in working environment: 
* Install Node. js and Grunt.
* Create a package. json and list dependencies (Grunt and plugins).
* Install NPM modules.
* Create Gruntfile. js .
* Configure tasks you need to run.
* Run those tasks in the command line while you work.


 same like above process we integrate  GRUNT with razorops using .razorops.yaml file
