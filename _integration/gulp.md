# What is gulp ?


Gulp is a task runner that uses Node. js as a platform. Gulp purely uses the JavaScript code and helps to run front-end tasks and large-scale web applications. It builds system automated tasks like CSS and HTML minification, concatenating library files, and compiling the SASS files.


# How to use GULP tool in working environment: 
* Install Node. js and Gulp.
* Create a package. json and list dependencies (Gulp and plugins).
* Install NPM modules.
* Create a gulpfile. js .
* Configure tasks you need to run.
* Run those tasks in the command line while you work.
