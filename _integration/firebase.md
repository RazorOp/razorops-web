Firebase is a platform developed by Google for creating mobile and web applications. It was originally an independent company founded in 2011. In 2014, Google acquired the platform and it is now their flagship offering for app development.

Firebase is an app development platform that helps you build and grow apps and games users love. Backed by Google and trusted by millions of businesses around the world. 

# Use cases                                                                    

Firebase use cases include:

*     Create onboarding flows – developers can give users a quick, intuitive sign-in process using Firebase Authentication. They allow users to sign into their apps via their Google, Twitter, Facebook or GitHub accounts in less than five minutes. Developers can also track each step of their onboarding flows to enhance the user experience. Additionally, developers can use Google Analytics for Firebase to log events at each step of their onboarding flows, create funnels to determine where users are dropping off and use remote configuration to make changes to their apps to see how those changes affect conversions.
*     Customize a “welcome back” screen – developers can use personalization to give every user the best experience by customizing the initial screen based on a user’s preferences, usage history, location or language. Developers can define audiences based, in part, on user behaviors and show targeted content to each audience.
*     Progressively roll out new features – developers can launch new features with minimal risk by first testing those features on a few users to see how they work and how users respond. Then, when developers are satisfied, they can roll out their apps to the rest of their users.

In June 2018, mobile security firm Appthority reported that thousands of iOS and Android mobile apps were exposing more than 113 GBs of data via 2,271 misconfigured Firebase databases.

Beginning in January 2018, Appthority researchers scanned mobile apps that used Firebase systems to store user data and analyzed communications pattern for requests made to Firebase domains.

After scanning over 2.7 million Android and iOS apps, researchers identified 28,502 mobile apps (1,275 iOS and 27,227 Android) that connected and stored data inside Firebase backends.
