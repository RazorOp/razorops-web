# Prerequisite :
 
* An existing Razorops account and GCP account
* Creating clusters on cloud GCP

**Github Repository :** https://github.com/Razorops-code/spring-boot.git 

You can create GKE cluster by following the official <a href="https://cloud.google.com/kubernetes-engine/docs/deploy-app-cluster#create_cluster" target="_blank"><b>documentation</b></a> or GUI model

After creating GKE cluster 

# Setting Up Cluster Access
To access a cluster using kubectl, you have to set up a Kubernetes configuration file (commonly known as a 'kubeconfig' file) for the cluster. The kubeconfig file (by default named config and stored in the $HOME/.kube directory) provides the necessary details to access the cluster. Having set up the kubeconfig file, you can start using kubectl to manage the cluster.  For razorops you can follow the process mentioned  here to access the cluster

# Next sign in to razorops with working github account

![](/images/integration/razorops-dashboard.png)


# Next move to kubernetes section and click on Add New 

![]()


# Next you navigate to add your existing cluster window 
Here you can add name for cluster and authentication method 
Here we can go with kubernetes ConfigFile (which is generated by connect <a href="https://docs.razorops.com/guides/kubernetes/connect/" target="_blank">credentials</a> )

# The config file will look like

![]()


# In authentication section: Just copy and paste and click on Create Cluster

![]()


# Next your cluster will added to Razorops kubernetes section successfully show like 

![]()


# Cluster added process completed with name Razo-gke

![]()



# Next move to workflow section for run a pipeline for deploy our application on to kubernetes eks cluster

![]()


 
# Now your in workflow dashboard

**You can navigate to the add a new pipeline dashboard by clicking on New Pipeline.**

# Next automatically 
* clone source code from repository  
* Build code with maven 
* Create image with dockerfile 
* Push the image from dockerhub repository
* Deploy the container on GKE cluster with kubernetes manifest file i.e (deployment.yml and service.yml )
* Access the application with NodePort ip service
