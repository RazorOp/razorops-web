# What are Artifacts?

An artifact is a byproduct of software development that helps describe the architecture, design and function of software. Artifacts are like roadmaps that software developers can use to trace the entire software development process


Artifacts might be databases, data models, printed documents or scripts. Artifacts aid in the maintenance and updating of software, as developers can use them as reference material to help resolve issues. Artifacts are documented and stored in a repository so they can be retrieved by software developers upon demand.


Software artifacts are typically created during the software development process and can refer to specific methods or processes in the software's development. For example, a software build contains the developer's code as well as a range of different artifacts. Some of these artifacts explain how the software works, while others enable the software to run. For example, the code's artifacts might include dependencies, project source code or a list of resources. These artifacts are stored in a repository, so they can be kept organized and retrieved upon demand.
