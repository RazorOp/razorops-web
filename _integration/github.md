Virtualization uses software to create an abstract layer over the hardware. By doing this it creates a virtual computer system, known as the virtual machines (VMs). This will allow organizations to run multiple virtual computers, operating systems, and applications on a single physical server



How Does Virtualization works:

Virtual machine (VM) is a virtual representation of a physical computer.Virtual machines can’t interrelate directly with a physical computer, but. Instead, it will require a lightweight software layer called a hypervisor to interact with the physical hardware during its run time.

The hypervisor is an essential part of virtualization , it’s a thin software layer that allows multiple operating systems to run parallel to each other and share the same physical computing resources.
