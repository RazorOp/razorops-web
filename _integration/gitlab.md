# Gitlab

Modules help you organize and re-use Terraform configuration. Follow the Modules Learn track to read about module basics, use your first module from the Terraform registry, and create a new module.

    Organize Configuration with Modules (complete all tutorials)

Review these additional resources to learn about modules and associated concepts in more depth.

    Finding and using modules documentation
    Module versioning documentation
    Input Variables documentation

    Output Values Learn tutorial
    Calling a child module documentation

The track and resources in this section will help you demonstrate that you can interact with Terraform modules. (Objective #5)
Â»Read and write configuration

Terraform uses its own configuration language to determine the goal state for the infrastructure it manages. The below resources describe some of the features of Terraform's configuration language.

    Resources describe infrastructure objects
    Data sources let Terraform fetch and compute data
    Query Data Sources Learn tutorial guides you through using data sources
    Resource addressing lets you refer to specific resources
    Named values let you reference values
    Create Resource Dependencies Learn tutorial guides you through managing related infrastructure using implicit and explicit dependencies
    Terraforms Resource Graph ensures proper order of operations
    Complex types let you validate user-provided values
    Built in functions help transform and combine values
    Perform Dynamic Operations with Functions Learn tutorial walks you through using Terraform functions
    Create Dynamic Expressions Learn tutorial shows you how to create more complex expressions
    Dynamic blocks allow you to construct nested expressions within certain configuration blocks

Because Terraform manages your infrastructure, it sometimes needs access to sensitive data. You can inject sensitive data into Terraform configuration using Vault. Review the following resources to learn about secure secrets injection.
