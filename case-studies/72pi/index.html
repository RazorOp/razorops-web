                The Challenge
            </h2>
            <p style="font-size: 19px;" class="case-desc">
                72pi team is focused on delivering a quick and remarkable experience to their users, and quickly
                adopting the very frequently changing fin-tech landscape. Hence, focus needs be more on development
                rather than deployments. They were looking for tools like razorops with the same spirit of putting
                development first. The team wanted a solution that is reliable, quick, robust and easy for them to use.

                Solution
            </h2>
            <p style="font-size: 19px;" class="case-desc">Once 72pi began using Razorops, they were happy as it was easy
                for them to adopt. It remarkably reduced their deployment time. The releases were quite often along with
                working on the feedback from the customer, and releasing the bits again, it helped them to improve their
                value proposition. Now they are able to move and fix faster with Razorops. Efficient feedback and a fast
                CI/CD pipeline allowed their team to do frequent end-to-end production deployments and get products into
                customers hands more quickly and efficiently.</p>
